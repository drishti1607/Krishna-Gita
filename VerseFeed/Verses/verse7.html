        7 (2-12): Is there anything other than the observable universe?
        In this Shloka, Krishna is explicit that all of us exist distinctly. He also makes it clear that there is something to us, other than our body. 
        This is not as obvious as it sounds, when we ask ourselves who we are. Our body is put together from atoms that are part of the universe. 
        In time, every atom in our body would be exchanged. So, everything just seems to be a part of the physical universe, where distinctions like 
        'you' and 'me' are not real and purely made for convenience. Within such a belief, our consciousness seems to be an imaginary concept in the physical universe.
