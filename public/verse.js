If the Lord were to be the only real entity without any attributes, unchanged and permanent, ignorance doesn't happen. <br>So, the Lord's statement that we are many and are distinct from the Lord couldn't have been made in ignorance. <br>What if knowledge and ignorance coexist in the Lord, who remains unaffected by that ignorance? The analogy given to illustrate this possibility is that of a burnt piece of cloth or paper, left undisturbed. Though it may have retained its shape, it doesn't have its original function. However, this doesn't hold either. For example, a mirage makes the illusion of water. <br>However, once we know that a mirage can do that, we will not reach out to fetch water from it or\u00a0initiate any action based upon such an illusion again. In the same way, if all distinctions were due to ignorance and such ignorance was resolved, there wouldn't be a situation in which the Lord would explain these distinctions to Arjuna. <br>There's no possibility of the Lord being under the influence of ignorance at some point in the past, as mentioned in the scriptures:<br>[mundakOpanishat], 1-2-6<br> says: He is aware of everything and knows everything.<br>[shvEtAshvatara], 6-8<br> says: The Lord's strength is described in many ways. Such strength is His by nature, along with knowledge, strength and His activities. <br>In Chap.7#26, the Lord says: I know the beings whose time has passed, who are present now and those who will be in the future. However, there isn't anyone who knows Me.<br>If indeed the Lord is the only one and the rest are imaginary, the Lord would know that and so would the people He teaches. Then whom will the Lord teach that there is only one? Everyone else would be imaginary.<br>What if there is only one and it appears multiple - like reflections? Arjuna, receiving the teaching, is like a reflection of the Lord. Any sane person wouldn't look at his own reflection on a shining surface and clarify these distinctions to it.<br>What if the Lord has the knowledge and is still limited by past ignorance? That doesn't hold either, let\u2019s see why. <br>Having knowledge and still being limited can be illustrated with an analogy - Suppose there is someone who sees two moons due to a defect in his vision. Even after he knows that there's only one moon, he can still see two moons. However, the defect in his sight doesn't cause any harm anymore. <br>This analogy doesn't hold in case of Krishna. There's no possibility of any defect returning. If at all a teacher has the complete knowledge that there is indeed a single Lord and nothing else is real, there's no possibility for him to explain anything to anyone - because they don't exist. If the teacher doesn't have such complete knowledge,\u00a0he cannot teach anyway. If the teacher is imaginary, then his teachings are also imaginary. If the purpose of the teaching was to get rid of ignorance, it applies to the teachers as well. If at all these distinctions are due to ignorance and if the teacher is free of such \u2018ignorance\u2019, whom will he teach?<br>"

For things that don\u2019t seem to exist, it\u2019s not evident.

Thus, things like creation and destruction are different states of an existing object. <br>'Destruction' is said to happen when an object, which is in the state called 'created', obtains a state that seems opposite to its created state.

For an object that exists in a certain state, obtaining the next state is its destruction. For the object in the succeeding state, obtaining that state itself is its creation. Thus, it\u2019s inevitable that any object that's affected by its environment undergoes a series of creations and destructions: There is no need to feel sorry about this.<br>Even the slightest sorrow that may arise on seeing an object change from one state to another does not arise in the case of humans and other beings \u2013 The Lord states that next.<br>"

The determination is to ascertain the true nature of the Self. <br>On the other hand, actions that are driven by desires are without such resolve. When we are driven by desires, it's just beneficial to know the distinction between the body and the Self. It\u2019s not necessary to realize the true nature of the Self. Even without ascertaining the real nature of the Self, it's possible to ask for desirable things, achieve them and enjoy them- there is nothing to oppose this.<br>The 'focused intention to achieve liberation' is said to be \u2018one\u2019, by virtue of having a single goal. A person who has the determination to achieve liberation would initiate all activity for the one end-result called <br>moksha<br>. Hence, given the same wisdom behind these activities, there is a single intent that drives all the actions. <br>As an analogy, take the intention to make money for the sake of money itself. There may be many different activities that can make money. The wisdom driving those activities is the practical awareness of capital. The intention behind all those activities is the same.<br>People without the determination to achieve liberation are ruled by actions to achieve various outcomes, such as children, wealth, food or a place in heaven. Due to the countless variety of outcomes, the intentions that drive those actions are uncountable as well. Also, they branch out variously in the form of differences and side-effect within the same goal. Hence, the intentions of people who do not have such determination have many branches and are countless.<br>"

Such is the relation between the person and activity. Thus, activity is certainly available to everyone, due to the influence of innumerable actions committed in the past. Activity is easy and isn\u2019t associated with the danger of ignorance. Hence, certainly perform action. <br>The word \u2018inactivity\u2019 is used here to mean 'the mere practice of contemplation without involving our organs in action'- see (Chap.3#4), where it says \u2018By avoiding actions, a person cannot get rid of the influence of his past deeds\u2019. Definitely, action is better than mere contemplation on the Self.<br>Even for a person who is able to contemplate on the Self as an intellectual activity, the pursuit is extremely difficult - that\u2019s because he does not have the experience of being inactive. It isn\u2019t possible to control this method. This pursuit is also associated with the danger of falling into ignorance. <br>Hence, being with activity is definitely better than merely striving for knowledge.<br>While imparting the knowledge of the Self in its true form, it is explained later (Chap.5#14) that the Self is not the doer when we perform an action \u2013 by its very nature, it doesn\u2019t make the outcome happen. Thus, the knowledge about the true nature of the Self is included inside actions that are performed without attachment to outcomes. In this way, these actions are superior.<br>The statement that activity is superior to inaction holds true indeed, even for a person who is able to focus on the Self. Suppose this person were to give up all activity, pursuing the knowledge of the Self alone. That\u2019s not entirely possible since the practice of contemplation itself happens as an activity inside his body and that is definitely not inactive. <br>Till the realization of the Self is complete, you need to be associated with a body.<br>Worship the Lord with wealth accumulated through just means. Conduct your journey in this life inside your body, with the balance coming from this worship. In the <br>[ChAndOgya upanishad]<br> (7-26-2), it is said- \u2018If what we eat is pure, the content of our body will be pure. When the content is pure, our <br>consciousness is firm<br>\u2018. Further on, in (Chap.3-13), it is said: \u2018The person who cooks for his own sake will suffer guilt\u2019. <br>Thus, even if an intellectual in the pursuit of the Self wanted to avoid activity, the journey through the life of his body would be impossible without any activity. This person needs to perform worship and other duties, till his goal of realizing the Self is met.<br>The realization of the Self comes from working without being driven by outcomes - by knowing the fact that the Self is <br>not the doer<br>. The ability to work is provided readily by nature- it is easily available. In summary, working without being driven by outcomes is superior, even for a person who is able to meditate on the Self as a purely intellectual activity.<br>Hence, without doubt, work without being driven by outcomes.<br>"

As opposed to this, actions done solely for personal gratification will bind and limit a person in this world. <br>Hence, work and prosper for the purpose of worship. In this process, be free of the attachment that results from doing things for personal gratification. When you work to worship the Lord, you are free from attachment and the Lord is gratified with your actions. He will free you from the influence of endless actions committed over time and grant you the realization of the Self and freedom from agitation.<br>The following Shlokas state that you need to take nourishment from the balance that comes out of worship. Take care of your body with such nourishment and achieve your goals. Nurturing the body with things other than this balance is a mistake.<br>"

The answer has been stated in this Shloka: \u2018The inherent knowledge in the Self is concealed by ignorance\u2019. What this sentence says is: We're constrained to experience the results of our actions, because the knowledge inherent within the Self is concealed by the influence of our actions \u2013 which we have committed since ancient times. This influence is unfavorable to the realization of the Self. In this way, the true nature of the Self - a form that is pure and infinite knowledge, is concealed by the influence of ancient actions committed by us.<br>Due to this influence, it gets associated with a particular body at a given point in time, resulting in mistaken notions about the Self. We derive perceptions, judgements and desires out of the results of our actions, in line with these mistaken notions about ourselves. Due to these notions, an impression of the Self arises, which is not at all our inherent nature. From that, the deeds that we commit arise \u2013 these are driven by our desires and they add on to the influence of our ancient actions.<br>Next, the Lord links up the statements in Chap.4#36 (\u2018You will cross over all the misery by the boat of knowledge alone\u2019), Chap.4#37 (\u2018In the same way, the fire of knowledge will burn down all your past actions\u2019), Chap.4#38 (\u2018There is nothing in this world, which is equal to knowledge in its flawlessness\u2019) and praises the appropriateness of the message contained in them.<br>"

              "In this Shloka, the Lord says that the people described till now pale in comparison with a person who surrenders to Him. This person is not one among them; he\u2019s in a different league.<br>To understand this commentary, it is necessary to know the usage of the various grammatical cases. The <br>[panchamI]<br> case means \u2018in comparison to\u2019, which denotes that the subject is distinct from the objects being compared. The <br>[ShaShThI]<br> case means \u2018among\u2019, which means the subject is one among the objects mentioned. In this Shloka, the person being described is different from others. We must pick up the \u2018in comparison to\u2019 case, not the \u2018one among the others\u2019 case.<br>The Shloka describes a person, different from all others who persevere to realize the Self. This description uses the ablative case (which means a comparison and separation \u2013 the <br>[panchami vibhakti]<br>) to denote all the others. <br>People who persevere to realize the Self were described at progressive stages of maturity, starting with Chap.6#26 till Chap.6#30. The person who is going to be described now is distinct from all these four types. <br>The genitive case (denoting \u2018belongingness\u2019 \u2013 the <br>[ShaShThI vibhakti]<br>) is not used, since this person is not merely a special one among others. The phrase \u2018even in comparison to all those who persevere to realize the Self\u2019 has been used in this Shloka. The word \u2018all\u2019 over here includes the people who perform penance and the others mentioned previously (Chap.4#28). Even here, the <br>[panchamI]<br> case is to be grasped, by the same logic mentioned before- the practitioner who is going to be described now has focused his mind the most. He is distinct in comparison to all those people.<br>In comparison to this person, the distinction between people mentioned previously (Chap.4#28) is insignificant. It is like comparing a fabulous mountain in the Himalaya and a minute mustard seed. Even though the mustard seeds have a perceptible difference and inequality among themselves, their insignificance is obvious when placed in perspective with the mountain.<br>This person has placed himself in Me by extreme affection and with the conviction that there is no protector other than Me. This person worships Me with strong intent and a sense of urgency to attain me, since he cannot tolerate even a moment of separation from Me \u2013 again, by an overload of affection towards Me. <br>\u2018Me\u2019 refers to Lord Krishna, whose playing field is the creation, evolution and destruction of the entire universe, which is endowed with a variety of things that are to be experienced, various species of beings that experience it, things that help in experiencing it and places where it can be experienced. <br>This is The Lord, whom no flaw can influence, who is an abode of unlimited amount of great knowledge, power, wealth, courage, strength, brilliance and uncountable other auspicious qualities, whose form is exactly the way He wishes, a form that is unthinkable in its entirety \u2013 divine, extraordinary, eternal, flawless, with limitless brilliance, beauty, aroma, tenderness, charm, youthfulness and is an abode to infinite such qualities. <br>His form and nature cannot be broken-down and understood either through speech or thought. He is a vast ocean of compassion, character, affection, generosity and protects all beings of the universe without exception, without regard to any of their peculiarities. <br>He takes away the pain from anyone who bows and submits to Him. He is a sea of affection to them. He is not visible to any human and never moves away from his true nature. <br>This is Krishna, who has taken birth in the house of Vasudeva, who brightens the world with his continuous and unsurpassed brilliance, who fills the universe with his splendor \u2013 is the kind of Lord worshipped by this person.<br>Lord Krishna concludes this chapter- I, the Lord who always brings everything everywhere into realization in its true form, consider this person to be the most focused, the best of the best among all beings.<br>"

The other one called <br>[archirAdi mArga], <br>literally \u2018the path of luster\u2019, is the one that leads to <br>Moksha<br> - freedom from this cycle.<br>The scriptures describe their path:<br><br>The <br>[panchAgni vidyA]<br> in <br>[ChAndOgya], 5-10-1<br> says: 'Those who know the true nature of the Self in this way, as well as those who worship the Lord by dedicating their thoughts to Him will take the path of luster and meet the dawn of freedom'. It describes the path that leads to the Lord Himself. <br>It also says that the path doesn\u2019t force you to return. <br>[ChAndOgya], 4-25-6<br> describes the end-point of this path: 'The guide leads them to the Lord. Once they proceed, they do not return to the cycles of this human world'.<br>The knowledge described above in the <br>[panchAgni vidyA]<br> is not about knowing the Self.

In <br>[ChAndOgya], 5-10-7<br>, it says that virtue leads to a fortunate configuration of the elements, like a human body. Vice leads to unfortunate configurations such as a dog or a pig. In this way, the scriptures describe the temporary entanglement between the Self and a body and the distinction between them. <br>[ChAndOgya], 5-10-7<br> continues to say that those who know this will take the path of luster and will not return to the birth-and-death cycle.<br>In this way, The Lord showed the distinction between the Self and the environment. We need to rise above the environment and gain consciousness that\u2019s separate from the environment. In this way we take the path of luster and don\u2019t need to return.<br>Having realized the true nature of the Self, a person knows that it has the Lord as its Self.

Those who have attained such freedom do have an origin, in that they attained freedom after being bound in the material world. <br>This is also evident from the <br>[shvEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-19<br>, where it says that the Lord exists without discontinuity. <br>In this Shloka, the Lord states - A person who knows Me in this way - as the Lord of the entire universe who is untouched by any flaw - is free of misconception. <br><br>'Misconception' is to consider the Lord as similar to something else. Unfortunately, such misconceptions prevent the start of <br>bhakti<br>. The person who does not have this opinion is free from misconception. Such a person is free from all misfortune that prevents the start of <br>bhakti<br>. <br>Any other wealthy or powerful leader is like another human. The person has attained that wealth and power due to deeds committed in the past. Same is the case with the <br>gods<br>, their superiors and Brahma, the principal engineer of the universe. They are subject to the influence of the <br>three qualities<br> too. The Lord is described as 'The one who created brahma' in <br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-8<br>.<br>Similarly, a wealthy person also belongs to the same category of people who are bound to the environment.<br>The Lord of the universe is distinct from all causes and effects we see in inanimate things. He is distinct from all conscious beings, whether <br>free<br> or bound in the environment. <br>The Lord has the distinction of having absolute control, being the terminator of all misfortune, the single supreme controller and the single abode of an infinite variety of abundant favorable qualities. The person who knows the Lord in this way doesn\u2019t think of the Lord as being similar to something else. This person is completely free of all misconceptions and misfortune.<br>In this way, the Lord described the removal of misfortune that prevents the birth of <br>devotion<br>. Such misfortune is removed by a study of the Lord's characteristics. He also said that the mere removal of such misfortune leads to <br>devotion<br>, which then springs forth by itself.<br>Next, the Lord describes the growth of devotion by studying His attributes, His wealth and the world of auspicious qualities that reside in Him.<br>"

For example, ignorance about jewelry would make us bundle gold and pearl together. Bias would prevent us from learning the distinction between them. When we are free from bias and ignorance, we are free from misconception.<br><br>\u2018Forgiveness\u2019 is a state where our mind isn\u2019t deformed even in the presence of agitation.<br>\u2018Truth\u2019 is to say it 'as it is', in a way that's beneficial to the listener. It is stated here as a tendency that enables us to do this.<br>\u2018Control over voluntary actions\u2019 is to desist from unfavorable subjects. Similarly, \u2018control over oneself\u2019 is the experience of controlling our thoughts and feelings- instead of being controlled by them.<br>\u2018Comfort\u2019 is the experience of things which are favorable to us, while \u2018discomfort\u2019 is the experience of something unfavorable.<br>\u2018The state of having plenty\u2019 is a state of mind that causes the feeling of comfort. \u2018The state of discontent\u2019 is fatigue in our mind, which causes an unfavorable experience.<br>\u2018Fear\u2019 is discomfort that comes from perceiving the cause of future misfortune. \u2018Fearlessness\u2019 is to be free of such fear.<br>The \u2018desire to avoid harming anyone\u2019 is the state of not being the cause of any misery.<br>The \u2018attitude of equanimity\u2019 is to view fortune and misfortune equally- whether it happens to us, to people we adore, or to those who oppose us<br>With the quality of \u2018contentment\u2019, we are always joyous towards everyone.<br>\u2018Focus\u2019 is to be engaged in the occupation prescribed for us, even when comfort and enjoyment are restrained.<br>\u2018Fame\u2019 is when we\u2019re known for virtuous qualities; \u2018Infamy\u2019 is to have a reputation of lacking virtue. Here, 'fame' and 'infamy' indicate the dual states of our mind associated with such reputations.<br>Similarly, the other virtues mentioned, such as 'focus' and 'charity' refer to our preferences and tendencies. <br>All of us in this world keep going through these emotions, experiences and states-of-being.

The ultimate form of enlightenment is described in the following scriptures -<br>[ChAndOgya upanishat], 3-13-7<br> describes the state-of-being enlightened with the Lord\u2019s awareness- \u2018It is the enlightenment that shines many times brighter than this daylight\u2019.<br>[ChAndOgya upanishat], 8-12-2<br> describes the person who is enlightened- \u2018Having attained the ultimate enlightenment, he comes forth in his own form\u2019.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka upanishat], 4-4-16 describes how he is viewed- The powerful consider Him as the brightness in everything that's bright.<br>Likewise, the Lord is the supreme purity - One who purifies all. To a person who remembers Him, the Lord grants freedom from disgrace and related mistakes. As said in the scriptures -<br>[ChandOgya upanishat], 4-14-3<br> speaks about such a person\u2019s mistakes- \u2018Mistakes do not stick to a person who worships this way, just as water does not stick to a lotus leaf\u2019.<br>[ChandOgya upanishat], 5-24-3<br> speaks about vice in such a person- \u2018Just as cotton gets burnt into ashes when it falls into fire, all vice in this person gets burnt away\u2019.<br>[mahAnArAyaNa], 21-3<br> talks about the supreme nature of the Lord- \u2018Narayana is the supreme might. Narayana is the supreme element. Narayana is the supreme enlightenment. Narayana is the supreme Self\u2019.<br>Arjuna continues- Great thinkers know the true nature of everything perceptible and non-perceptible. O Lord, they say You alone are the everlasting divine person, the origin of all <br>powers<br>, You are without an origin. You are the One who is all-pervading. The sage Narada and the unbound pious Vedavyasa too say the same. From the scriptures -<br>[harivamsha, vishNu parva], 123-62<br> describe Lord Krishna- \u2018This Narayana has the sea of milk as his mansion, has Lakshmi by his side. He has left his serpent that serves as his resting place and has come down to Mathura city\u2019.<br>[bhArata.araNya.], 86-28,25 says- \u2018The city of Dwaraka is indeed fortunate, because Lord Krishna is present there. He is the Lord who can be seen, He is beginning-less, He is indeed the eternal and supreme law\u2019.<br>[bhArata.vana.], 76-24,28 describes those who know Krishna- \u2018Learned people who know the Vedas, those who are aware of the knowledge of the Self say that the great Lord Krishna is the eternal and supreme law. Govinda is the purest of the pure, the highest among all virtues and the most favorable among everything that's auspicious. The Lord is the entire universe and all the <br>powers<br> in it. He is ancient, older than everything else. The Lord Hari, who cannot be grasped by thought, is now present here as Krishna.<br>In [bhArata.vana.], 90-28,32, Krishna Himself tells Arjuna- \u2018Wherever the ancient and supreme being, Lord Narayana is present, that\u2019s where the entire world is. It is home, with all the wholesome rivers. Such a place is virtuous. It is a place of focused thought. That is itself the ultimate entity, which extends through-out the universe. It is a place of powerful scholars, people with great achievements and those who have focused their thoughts... Lord Krishna, present as the origin of all power and as the great performer, is the most favorable of all places. Have no doubt in this matter\u2019.<br>[bhArata.sabha.], 38-33 echoes- \u2018Lord Krishna himself is the creation and destruction of all the worlds. Along with everything with consciousness and without, this entire universe exists only for His purpose\u2019.<br>Finally, Arjuna recalls what Krishna said- \u2018You have said so Yourself, in <br>Chap.7#4<br>: This universe of Mine is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of individuality. Up until <br>Chap.10#8<br>: People with this knowledge worship Me with the conviction that I am the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me. They are filled with feelings of adoration for Me\u2019.<br>"

Knowledge, memory and the ability to reason come from Me'. <br>In Chap.18#61, He says: \u2018Arjuna, the Supreme Lord sits at the heart of every being, spinning all beings, mounting them in the mechanism of the environment\u2019.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 5-7-15 describes everything as the Lord\u2019s body: 'The One who is present in all beings, who is distinct from all of them, the One whom all beings do not know, the One who has all beings <br>as His body<br>, the One who controls all beings while being inside them - He is inside you too; He is the Self that doesn't perish'.<br>[shatapatha], 14-5-30<br> states that the Self is also the Lord\u2019s body: 'The One who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self, the One whom the Self does not know, the One who has the Self <br>as his body<br>, the One who controls the Self while being inside it - He is the One who is within you and regulates your feelings; He is the Self that does not experience death.<br>In this way, being present <br>as the Self<br> in all beings, I am their beginning, their end, as well as everything in-between.

Knowing that every word addresses the Lord is a way to establish the uniqueness of His mighty expanse. <br>Indeed, all words ultimately conclude in the Lord, since they have the Lord as their 'Self'. They have the Lord as the basis and essence of their existence. While words such as 'person', 'bird', 'tree' are used to describe the material forms of those things, they address the 'essence' that constitute their being - their Self. <br>The Lord says that all words are bound to address Him, due to the fact that the Lord is <br>present as the Self<br>- the essence and the basis inside everything. <br>The Lord sums up His expanse in Chap.10#39: \u2018An object in which I'm not present as its Self does not exist\u2019. This is a statement of fact- it's impossible for anything to exist without the Lord being its basis.<br>Further, He states that this existence is subject to His will in Chap.10#8: Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me.<br>From the next Shloka till the end of this chapter, the Lord illustrates several ways to relate to His greatness.<br>"

              "Here, the words \u2018perpetual\u2019 and 'unmanifest' refer to the Self, which is self-evident in each of us. <br>It is inscrutable. Since it\u2019s distinct from the body, it can\u2019t be described by words that are used to describe the body. For instance, being male, female, ordinary or powerful doesn\u2019t describe its properties in any way.  Hence, it\u2019s not perceived by sight, speech or any of our senses. <br>This Shloka states that it is present in every body and cannot be deciphered by thought. Though the Self is present in the body, it doesn\u2019t have any characteristics of the body. Hence, it cannot be deciphered in terms of those characteristics.<br>By being distinct from the body, it remains unchanged like an anvil, even though its body keeps changing. By this, the characteristics of the Self remain unaffected by all the effects of its body. By virtue of remaining constant, it is termed as being 'unmoved and steadfast' in this Shloka.<br>Our body is a community of organs. When people focus on the Self, they control the body well. They employ their organs such as sight and hearing, instead of transacting to pursue their satisfaction.<br>They have an attitude of universal equanimity. While we perceive huge variety in our bodies, they know that the Self inside all bodies is present in the form of pure knowledge - no matter how small, large or powerful the being is.<br>With this attitude, they wish everyone well. They are free from all intentions that cause harm. That's because the intention to harm is a limitation, which comes by considering inequalities. The Self in each of us is identical.<br>By focusing on the Self, they will certainly attain Me - in addition to realizing their Self. This is stated in Chap.14#2: \u2018Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics\u2019. It is also stated in the <br>[muMDaka upanishat], 3-1-3:<br> [niranjana: paramam sAmyam upaiti] - 'Devoid of flaws, it attains ultimate equality with the Lord'.<br>Though the Self is permanent and achieves ultimate equality with the Lord, it remains distinct. This is said in Chap.15#16: 'The Self stays without deforming and is said to be the imperishable\u2019, going on to Chap.15#17: \u2018However, the Supreme Person is another one\u2019. <br>The <br>[mundaka upanishat], 1-1-5<br> narrates: A sage called Shyavanaka went to another sage called Angirasa and asked to be taught. Angirasa started his teaching with the statement: 'There are two types of learning, the material and the superior. Material science is about observations and creativity in the universe'. He goes on to say: 'Superior learning is the awareness by which the Supreme Lord can be attained'. <br>This teaching is called <br>[akShara vidya]<br> \u2013 \u2018The science of the perpetual\u2019. In the <br>[akShara vidya], <br>the word 'perpetual' has been used to denote the Supreme Lord, rather than the Self. The Supreme Lord is described to be the creator of all beings. <br>The word <br>[akShara]<br> - 'the perpetual' - has been used in the scriptures, to mean the Self in some places and the Lord in others. Even then, the Self and the Lord remain distinct \u2013 The Lord creates all beings and the Self does not.<br>Nevertheless, it\u2019s extra tough to focus interest on the unmanifest Self. The goal of realizing the Self is reached with great difficulty, while being associated with a body. We are predisposed to consider our body as our Self.<br>Next, the Lord clearly asserts that He is always there for His worshippers.<br>"

              "The capability to 'know' is the single characteristic of the Self in every body. It doesn\u2019t depend on the characteristics of the body \u2013 whether it\u2019s ordinary, powerful, intelligent, ugly or beautiful.<br>The Lord is the essence of the Self. Krishna tells Arjuna to know this.<br>In this Shloka, the phrase 'as well' in the statement 'Know Me to be the knower as well' implies that the Lord must be known as the '<br>knower<br>' as well as the '<br>field of action<br>'. <br>A living body merely qualifies the Self and doesn\u2019t exist without it. When we point out someone\u2019s body, we address their Self. They are both referenced in the same way. Similarly, the body and the Self exist as inseparable attributes of the Lord. The Lord refers to the Self as Himself in this Shloka.<br>Our body is a combination of the five elements of the environment - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. Both our body and the Self exist <br>as the body of the Lord<br>. They don\u2019t have any other existence. In other words, both of them have the Lord as their essence. <br>This is stated in many scriptures, which are listed here:<br>The [br\u2019hadArAnyaka, 3-7-3] states: 'The One who is inside all matter, while being distinct it; The One whom matter cannot encode; The One who has all matter <br>as his body<br>; The One who controls all matter from the inside - Such a Self is all-pervasive and ever-lasting'. <br>Starting with that statement, it finishes describing the concept in [br\u2019hadArAnyaka, 3-77-22]: 'The One who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self; The One whom the Self does not know; The One who has the Self <br>as His body<br>; The one who controls the body from within - that is the essence of your Self, it is ever-lasting'.<br>The Lord is all-pervasive and is present as the essence of every Self. Hence, when we point out anything, we are actually addressing the Lord. It is stated in the following Shlokas:<br>Chap.10#20: \u2018I am situated in all beings at their core as the Self. Moreover, I am the beginning, as well as the end and everything in-between\u2019<br>Chap.10#39: \u2018Whatever is the source of all beings, I am that. It is impossible for any being, moving or stationary, to exist without Me\u2019<br>Chap.10#42: \u2018I support and control this entire universe, which is situated in one part of My being.\u2019<br>In the second half of the tenth chapter, the Lord described that he is the Self, the essence of everything. In the midst of that description, the Lord described Himself as many special things by saying \u2018I am Vishnu\u2019, \u2018I am the sun\u2019 and so on. For instance, He says in Chap.10#21: \u2018In the <br>powers of nature<br>, I am Vishnu, the all-pervasive. In all luminous things, I am the sun that has the greatest brightness. Among the powers of war, I am the most powerful. Among the stars, I appear as the moon\u2019<br>The difference between kshetra and kshetrajna and the fact that I am the Self to both of them \u2013 that is the awareness you must have.<br>In this Shloka, He says - 'Learn to differentiate the <br>field of action<br> and the one who experiences this field. I recommend you to realize that I am the essence of both'.<br>The following paragraph tries out an opposing explanation, which ends in contradiction.<br>In this Shloka, the Lord has said - 'Know Me to be the knower'. This can be interpreted as a statement of equivalence, to mean that the Lord and the Self are the same entity. The Self within us hasn\u2019t realized that it is the Lord. This leads to the conclusion that the Lord, being present as the Self, does not realize Himself to be the Lord - due to ignorance. <br>We could hypothesize that such statements of equivalence are meant to get rid of such ignorance: For example, we may mistake a rope to be a snake. When someone shows us that it\u2019s only a rope, our ignorance is gone. In the same way, what if our awareness that 'I am aware and I\u2019m distinct from the Lord' is ignorance and this Shloka aims to remove such ignorance?<br>Now the contradiction is presented.<br>Those who argue in this manner say that the Lord and the Self are the same entity. They are to be questioned: 'The Lord, who has taught us all this - Lord Krishna - is He free from the so-called \u2018ignorance\u2019, which says that the Self and the Lord are distinct? Or not? <br>If He is free of such \u2018ignorance\u2019, then His Self has the characteristic of pure knowledge. Being devoid of any other attribute, there is no possibility to consider Arjuna to be distinct from Himself. Hence, there\u2019s no possibility to explain anything and get rid of anyone\u2019s ignorance.<br>On the other hand, if we consider that Krishna is not free of ignorance, not having realized the Self, then the possibility to teach the subject of the Self does not arise. <br>It was said in Chap.4#34: \u2018Those who know and show the way will preach this knowledge to you\u2019 \u2013 people learn to be aware of the Self. <br>Thus, such arguments, which say that the Lord and the Self are not distinct, go against the scriptures and other Shlokas in the Gita itself. They make the great scriptures self-contradictory. They must not be accepted, since they only serve to mislead everyone. <br>What can we conclude from this reasoning?<br>The concept to be grasped from this discussion is: There exists inanimate matter, the conscious Self and the Supreme Lord. Inanimate matter is to be experienced, the conscious Self is the one who experiences and the Lord is the controller. <br>Let\u2019s learn about the Lord, the Self and the environment<br>There are many statements in the scriptures that speak about their distinguishing characteristics:<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishad], 4-6<br> illustrates that the Lord is distinct from those who are bound by their deeds: The amazing Lord creates this universe out of the <br>subtle singularity<br> at the time of creation. There is another, who is bound by his past deeds.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-10<br> illustrates that the Lord and the environment are distinct: Know this environment as an amazing creation and the Lord as the amazing creator.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-10:<br> The environment keeps changing. The one who assumes that he is the enjoyer of environment is the unchanging Self. There is One Lord who controls both of them. The Lord removes the ignorance that the Self controls the environment.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-9:<br> He is the cause; He is the Lord of the owner of the body; Nobody has given birth to Him; Nobody has control over Him.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-13:<br> He is the Lord of the environment and the one who knows the field of action; He is the lord of the <br>three qualities<br>.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-9:<br> He is the Lord of the universe and of the Self; He is ever-lasting, auspicious and never diminishes. He is the unborn Lord of those who know and those that don't.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-3:<br> He is the ever-lasting consciousness among the many ever-lasting consciousness, He is the one who grants their wishes (meaning, the Lord is present inside the Self, present as the ever-lasting entity in each conscious being, the One who grants their wishes).<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-5:<br> The one who experiences, that which is experienced and the One who inspires everything - they are respectively the Self, the environment and the Lord.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-6:<br> The <br>devotee<br> attains <br>immortality<br> through the Lord by pleasing Him. The Self is distinct, having the Lord as inspiration and purpose.<br> <br>[munDaka upanishat], 3-1-1:<br> Two birds are friends. They exist together in a tree. One of them tastes the fruit of the tree, while the other stays without eating, shining brilliantly. The tree is like our body. The bird that tastes the fruit is the Self, which experiences the results of its actions. The one that shines forth brilliantly is the Lord, who is not under the influence of His deeds, hence does not have to eat the fruits of His actions.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-5:<br> The eternal <br>three qualities<br> \u2013 the white <br>sattva<br>, red <br>rajas<br> and dark <br>tamas<br> - give rise to many bodies, which are in turn loaded with those qualities. An eternal Self lies happily in this environment. An eternal Self that practices <br>devotion<br> leaves this environment.<br>[chUlakOpanishat], 5:<br> The environment, which is without a beginning and an end, gives rise to the bodies of all beings. <br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-7:<br> The Self is trapped in the body. Without control, it is saddened due to ignorance. Once it realizes the other controller inside the same body, it realizes The Lord in all His greatness. It is gladdened and is rid of all sorrow.<br>These were some of the scriptures in which the relation between the Self and the Lord is depicted, along with the fact that they are distinct from each other and distinct from the environment too.<br>Let\u2019s look at our origin<br>Even in the Gita, there are many verses that state the origin of the Self and the universe:<br>Chap.7#4, Chap.7#5: \u2018This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, energy, gasses, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of individuality. However, this universe I just described is not the ultimate one. Know My ultimate nature, which is something distinct, in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is sustained\u2019<br>Chap.9#7, Chap.9#8, Chap.9#10: \u2018All beings end up in a dormant state in My body at the end of a <br>kalpa<br>. Again, at the beginning of the next <br>kalpa<br>, I create them in various forms. I create this entire system of beings again and again, while keeping My material nature as the basis. Since they are under the influence of the material world, they are not free. These activities of mine don\u2019t bind Me. Being neutral, I have no attachment towards those activities. The material environment guides this world with all its stationary and mobile beings according to My will. I am the supreme controller. This world goes through its cycles for this purpose itself\u2019<br>Chap.13#14: Know the environment and the Self to be without a beginning.<br>Chap.14#3: This huge universe is my creation. In that, I give birth. Then, the birth of all beings takes place.<br>Meaning - The huge universe arises from the subtle matter, which is an attribute of mine. In this environment, which is without consciousness, I place the womb of consciousness. This association of the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment happens by My will. Such association gives rise to all beings in the material world, from the mighty and powerful right upto the immobile.<br>In this Shloka, the environment - the huge universe - is called <br>[brahma]<br>. It doesn't mean that it's the same as The Lord, who is also called by the same word. The word <br>[brahma]<br> is used to refer to our environment in other scriptures as well. For example, <br>[muMDaka]<br> 1-1-9 says: 'From that, the universe called as <br>[brahma], <br>arises'.<br>In this way, the conscious and non-conscious exist as those who experience and that which is experienced. They exist in this way in all states of being. The Lord is the inseparable essence of their existence. Several scriptures state this fact and they are quoted here once again:<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3: The One who is situated in the earth and pervades it; The One whom the earth does not know; The One whose <br>body is the earth<br>; The One who controls the earth from its core. <br>Let\u2019s look at our relationship with the Lord.<br>Similarly, other scriptures describe how the Lord is related to the Self:<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: The One who is situated in the Self and pervades it; The One whom the Self does not know; The One whose <br>body is the Self<br>; The One who controls the Self from its core.<br>Identical statements are present in <br>[subAla upanishat], <br>illustrating that the universe, our environment and the Self are the <br>body of the Lord<br>: 'The One who is active inside the earth; The One <br>whose body is the earth<br>; The One whom the earth does not know', 'The One who is active in the Self; The One <br>whose body is the Self<br>; The One whom the Self does not know' and 'The One who is active in the perishable; The One <br>whose body it is<br>; The one whom the perishable does not know. <br>In this way, Lord Narayana is the core Self of all beings, untainted by actions, distinct from the material world, shining forth, the one and only supreme entity. <br>This Upanishad uses the word 'perishable' to refer to everything without consciousness, which existed in <br>subtle form<br> before creation. It is also called <br>[tamas]<br>. The usage of the word <br>[tamas]<br> to mean the <br>subtle environment<br> is evident in the same Upanishad: 'The body perishes in the Self and becomes subtle, taking the state of <br>[tamas]<br>'.<br>These statements are reiterated in in [ya.A], 3-11-2: 'The Lord is the Self inside everyone, controlling them'.<br>In this way, everything exists <br>as the Lord's body<br>, be it conscious or non-conscious, in every state of being. In fact, everything is a form of the Lord Himself. The Lord Himself exists as the origin of the universe, as a <br>subtle singularity<br> before creation. He exists as the effect as well, which is the entire universe after creation. <br>"

              "The Lord is both the effect and the cause",
              "Here are a few scriptures that remind us of this fact. They state that both the cause and the effect are the Lord Himself:<br>Starting with <br>[ChAndOgya], 6-2-1:<br> <br>[sadEva saumyEdamagramAsIt EkamEvAdvitIyam]<br>Prior to creation, this universe was present as <br>[sat]<br> - a subtle form, indistinguishable from the Lord. It alone existed, there was nothing else.<br>[ChAndOgya], 6-2-3:<br> [tadaikShata bahusyAm prajayEyEti tattEjO_sr'jata]<br>It willed to become many. It created energy and the material world.<br>[ChAndOgya], 6-8-6:<br> [sanmUlA: sOmya imA: sarvAn prajA: sadAyatanA: satpratiShThA:]<br>It is the origin of everything and everyone. It - this <br>[sat]<br> - is the place of residence for all beings, The One in which all beings return when the universe perishes.<br>[ChAndOgya], 6-8-7:<br> <br>[aitadAtmyam idam sarvam tat satyam sa AtmA tat tvam asi shvEtakEtO]<br>This is at the core, present as the Self inside everything. This is the truth. You are such a Self.<br>The <br>[taittarIya], 2-6<br> starts with 'He willed to be many beings. He gave thought to it. He created all of this by his thought', going on to state: 'The Ultimate Consciousness became the conscious and the non-conscious'.<br>This is repeated in the Chandogya Upanishad, as in <br>[ChAndOgya], 6-3-2:<br>I enter the core of the three powers - energy, liquids and solids - and enable them to be called by names and be recognized by form.<br>The <br>[taittarIya], 2-6<br> also states: Creating this universe, It entered and pervaded that universe itself; having pervaded, It gave rise to the Self and its association with the environment, the power to discern and the lack of it too. This <br>[sat]<br> is The Lord. He became the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment.<br>Before the time of creation, only an undivided entity existed without the possibility to distinguish and name anything. Only after the Lord's act of creation, this entity was separated into things that could be distinguished and named.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7 also states the same:<br>All of this existed without being distinct, before the time of creation. The Lord made them distinct, after which they could be called by names.<br>Hence the gross universe, which is the effect of creation, as well as the <br>subtle cause<br> that existed before creation, all conscious and non-conscious things <br>are the Lord's body<br>. The effect is not different from the cause. In this way, by knowing the cause, we know everything that's created out of it. It is appropriate to say that knowledge of one gives the knowledge of everything. <br>For example: A pot is made out of clay. It\u2019s possible to consider the pot as clay, while acknowledging that they have different characteristics and uses. Knowing the properties of clay enables us to know a pot and everything else that\u2019s made out of clay. <br>Quoting <br>[ChAndOgya], 6-3-2<br> again:<br>'I enter the three powers - energy, liquids and solids - by being at the core of every Self and distinguish them to be called by names' - The 'three powers' here denote the non-conscious elements in the environment. The Lord enters them as the core of the Self in each object, which enables them to be distinguished, recognized and named. <br>In this way, every sound and expression addresses the Lord, who is adorned with the Self and its inanimate matter. Thus the Lord, who is present as the ultimate cause, has equivalence with everything that's created - this is the primary meaning embedded here.<br>If the Lord has equivalence to everything, does it mean He has ignorance as well?<br>It is already said that the Lord is the material cause of the universe with its conscious beings and non-conscious things. He is the subtle form before creation as well as the gross result of creation - the universe we are in. Being the material cause implies that the Lord Himself became the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment. <br>Though the Lord has the Self and the environment <br>as His body<br>, even though He is the material cause of their association, He remains distinct from them - the characteristics of the Lord are not mixed up with the characteristics of the Self or the environment. <br>How is it possible that the Self and the environment remain distinct, even though they are part of the Lord\u2019s <br>body<br>? Here\u2019s an analogy: <br>Just as colorful threads that are white, black or red come together to create cloth, the thread and the cloth remain distinct with different characteristics. While threads are the only material cause of a colorful cloth, each color is localized to the thread that went into making the cloth - even in the resulting cloth, the colors don't mix. The characteristics of the cloth are distinct from those of the threads.<br>"

              "The Self and the environment are effects of the Lord\u2019s creation",
              "The Self, the environment and the Lord combine to be the material cause of this world. While they are effects of the Lord's creation, their characteristics don't get mixed up. The Self remains the one who experiences; the environment is the one that\u2019s experienced and the Lord is the One who controls.<br>Threads, which normally remain separate, are woven together at the will of a weaver at some instant. These threads are both the material cause and the effect. <br>Similarly, the Self and the environment in all states of being - either the subtle form before creation or the gross form after creation - are the <br>body of the Lord<br>. They exist as entities only in the form of the <br>Lord's body<br>. Their form is the Lord Himself, both as the cause and the observed effect. He is the One addressed by all words, all the time - This is His specialty. <br>The environment, the Self and the Lord have distinct characteristics \u2013 The environment is inanimate, without consciousness; The Self is knowledge, which is limited in its expression according to the actions committed by the Self; The Lord always has infinite knowledge. <br>As in the case of threads combining to make cloth, their characteristics remain distinct and don\u2019t get mixed up. Given this, it's easy to recognize that the Lord's characteristic remains unchanged even after He enters everything in the created universe. <br>We realize again: In addition to being the cause, The Lord is also the effect of creation with its variety of entities that have various names and classifications. The Lord is present as the Ultimate Self inside everything. The word 'effect' just means that a different state of being is attained.<br>Those who vouch for the Lord as being 'without form and without qualities' mean that the Lord is devoid of any limiting qualities.<br>[ChAndOgya, daharavidyA], 8-1-5<br> describes that the following qualities are present in a small space inside our hearts: First, it is stated that this space is without limitations: Without flaws, without ageing, without death, without sorrow, without hunger, without thirst. The Lord is present in this space. His auspicious qualities are described: He has everything He wished; His every will is realized.<br>The Lord is without limitations. The word \u2018<br>qualities<br>\u2019 often refers to our limitations. Hence the statement is made in some scriptures that 'The Lord is without qualities'.<br>Certain scriptures describe the Lord as having a form of pure knowledge. They refer to the form of the Lord, who knows everything and is all-powerful, as being represented by pure knowledge that shines forth by its own strength. The form of the Lord is knowledge; He is devoid of limitations and has all auspicious qualities.<br>As said in <br>[muNDaka], 1-1-9:<br>He knows the broad expanse of knowledge and has depth in each subject.<br>In <br>[shvEtAshvatara], 6-8:<br>The Lord's ultimate strength is heard in many different ways. This strength is natural to Him, so are his knowledge, power and activities.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 2-4-14 remarks:<br>With what should we know the One who is the knower? This question reflects that we can know the Lord, who knows everything and is knowledge Himself, only with His grace.<br>The statement in <br>[taittarIya], 2-1:<br> <br>[satyam jnAnam anantam brahma]<br>'The Lord is the truth, knowledge and is without an end' - Refers to the Lord in the form of knowledge that shows itself. When we are rid of the influence of our deeds, this knowledge shines forth by itself and we realize the Lord.<br>Many scriptures state that the Lord became the universe with all its beings. Let's look at them next:<br>[taittarIya], 2-6<br> says: 'The Lord wished to become many'. So also does the <br>[ChAndOgya], 6-2-3:<br> 'The Lord willed to be many' and the [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7: 'It distinguished itself into many forms and names'. All of them state that the Lord Himself is present in many forms by His own will - this constitutes all of the various states and forms in which we see things.<br>Several scriptures state that nothing exists without having the Lord at the core of its Self. The existence of many independent things is a myth:<br>[kaThOpanishat], 2-2-10<br> starts with: 'The person who sees differently over here will go from one death to another' and goes on to say: <br>[nEha nAnA_sti kinchana]<br> - 'Many different things don't exist here'.<br>Similarly, [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 2-4-14 says: 'The person who believes that there is a second thing separate from the Lord will see various different things. The person who believes that everything has the Lord as the ultimate Self - what does he see, using what does he see?' <br>Meaning, both the eye and the object of sight have the Lord as their Self.<br>Quoting <br>[ChAndOgya], 6-2-3<br> again: 'It gave rise to many'.<br>"

              "Scriptures like these state that the many things we experience are the Lord's form, created by the Lord's will. Of course, this does not deny the existence of the Lord in multiple forms, resulting in the experience of multiple things. <br>Statements like the one in [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 4-5-15: 'When a person sees everything as his Self' - may seem like they deny variety. Yet, their meaning is realized by keeping in mind that everything is a form of the Lord. Further reinforcing this, [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 2-4-6 says: 'All knowledge stands against a person who believes that there are things that don't have the Lord as the Self'<br>[subAla], 2<br> says: All Vedas are just the breath of the great Lord.<br>In this way, the scriptures that describe the distinct forms and characteristics of the Self, the environment and the Lord do not contradict the other scriptures that hold out the singularity of cause and effect, describing everything as the Lord Himself. <br>The Self and the environment exist <br>as the body of the Lord<br> always. They have the Lord at the core, controlling them. This holds good in the subtle form in which they were present before creation - when they could not be distinguished by form and name. It also holds in their explicit form after creation, when they can be distinguished by names. This is known from all scriptures. <br>If we take the scriptures stating the singularity of the Lord literally, then the Self would itself be the Lord, then the Lord would have ignorance. This goes against all knowledge in the scriptures. There is no scope of maintaining this kind of singularity.<br>This was a very elaborate and sufficient discussion of the subject.<br>"

              "The true nature of the body and the Self has been told by Rishis such as Parashara in many ways.<br>Parashara was a great sage who described the three elements in the Vishnu Purana - the Self, the environment and the Lord. In that, he also described the achievement of <br>Moksha<br>.<br>There, he explains the three elements through an anecdote: There was once a king called Bahuguna. He set out on a palanquin, normally to be carried by four people. On that day, only three had turned up. Three people couldn\u2019t hold it. Hence, the king called on Jadapradha, who was standing by the side. Jadapradha was a sage with vast knowledge, but looked quite ordinary. Hence the king mistook him for a commoner. Jadapradha lifted the palanquin. However, due to lack of practice, he did not lift well. <br>The king reprimanded him and Jadapradha replied - 'When you told me to lift this, did you tell my body or my Self? What lifted it? The body or the Self? What are you and what am I? Hearing this, the king realized that the person is no commoner. He requested Jadapradha to teach him. A part of that teaching follows now:<br>In the <br>[vishNu purANa], 2-13-69<br>,70,71: \u2018O King! You, I and others have been conceived with the elements. All our bodies are bogged down by the flood of three qualities. These qualities - <br>sattva, rajas and tamas<br> - are dictated by the past deeds we committed. <br>The deeds that we commit are born out of ignorance. Ignorance is of two types - One is a belief that our body is our Self; Another is that the Self is independent of the Lord. This is true of all beings. The Self is pure, peaceful and never wears out. It is not made from <br>the three qualities<br>, it is superior, beyond any material\u2019.<br>This is continued in <br>[vishNu purANa], 2-13-89<br>,102,103: \u2018The Self is separate from the body, which is made up of the head and various other organs. Given this, what do I address, by the word 'me'? Are you this head? Or the chest? Or the stomach? Or the collection of legs and other organs? <br>O King, you are distinct from all these parts of your body. Think about who you are. Focus your intelligence on this. These two distinct entities - the Self and the environment - both have the <br>Lord as the Ultimate Self<br>\u2019.<br>This is also summarized at the end of the Vishnu Sahasranama: The organs, the mind, the intellect, the elements, energy, strength, steadfastness - all of them have the Lord as their Ultimate Self - as does the body and the Self.<br>The distinction between the body and the Self has been told in the other Vedas as well. <br>The origin and nature of the body is described in <br>[Anandavalli], 1:<br> 'Space came into being from this Ultimate Self; Space carries fields (such as gravitational and electromagnetic fields); From these fields, energy came into being; From energy, fluids arose; Fluids became solids and planets. From the material of the planets arose organic compounds. Food in the form of vegetation is formed out of these compounds. From this food, the body of a person comes into being. Thus, a person is made from food and liquids'.<br>The Upanishad described the nature of the body as being made out of food. It goes on to state that the body has the breath of life and is pervaded by a mind. The Self resides in the body that\u2019s pervaded by the mind. Yet, it is distinct from the body and the mind. <br>Having described the nature of the Self in this way, it goes on to say: \u2018This Self has the Ultimate Self residing in it, being with infinite knowledge and filled with pure joy\u2019. <br>In this way, the Vedas clearly state the distinction between the nature of the body and the mind. They state the fact that both of them have the Lord at their core. The Lord is the Ultimate Self.<br>The verses of the Brahmasutra describe the Lord as the owner of the Self and the body. They do so with conviction and logic. They start by establishing that space itself did not exist forever, that it came into existence at the time of creation. They go on to describe the nature of the body - the <br>field of action<br>. Then they describe the true form of the Self - the Self always exists in the form of awareness.<br>Finally, they describe the relation between the Self and the Lord, by saying that the Self is a doer of actions. That doership is entirely under the will of the Lord. The Lord sets the Self into action \u2013 even in this way, the Self has the Lord at its core. <br>The reality of the Self and its field of action have been elaborated in various scriptures in many ways. The Lord says - 'Now listen to Me, I will describe it in a clear and brief way'. <br>"

This list described the ingredients involved in the origin of the body. The body is made from the five elements - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. These five elements originated from the particles that were formed during creation. These particles resulted from the state of expansion, also termed as cosmic inflation. <br><br>Before the state of expansion, all of this existed in a subtle form, incapable of being distinguished with names. That is the \u2018subtle singularity\u2019.<br>The 'ten organs with the mind and the five stimuli' are the entities that have the body as their home. Our ears, nose, eyes, tongue and skin are the five sense organs. Speech, hands, legs and the two excretory organs are the organs of action. The mind has the body as its home too, as do the five stimuli of the senses - sound, touch, form, taste and smell.<br>Feelings of desire, hatred, comfort and sorrow are associated with the body. Hence, they are considered to be variations in the state of the body.<br>To clarify: Though desire, hatred, comfort, sorrow are experienced by the Self, those experiences come out of its association with the body. Since these experiences are effects of the body, they are considered as different states of the body. This is stated later in this chapter, <br>Chap.13#20<br>: 'The Self experiences comfort and sorrow by virtue of being associated with the body'. <br>A combination of all these elements constitutes the body, which exists as a base on which the Self can experience feelings such as comfort and sorrow. The body is the base for worldly experience as well as the achievement of <br>Moksha<br>. That is why this Shloka states that 'The body supports the existence a conscious being'.<br>In this way, the <br>field of action<br> - our body - started with the environment in the <br>subtle singularity<br> and ended up in this world. It is made out of the five elements, contains the organs and undergoes change due to love, hatred, comfort or pain. It is a combination of all these entities, existing as a base for the conscious Self to have its experiences.

You will grasp the Self with this knowledge. <br>By nature, the Self is not subject to the laws of the material world. It is free of birth, old age and death. It has no beginning, likewise no ending either. This is said in <br>[kaTha upanishat], 2-18:<br> 'It is not born, does not perish, it is full of wisdom'. <br>The Self realizes My supremacy, as I said in Chap.7#5: \u2018Know My ultimate nature in the form of a conscious being, by whom this world is sustained\u2019<br>By being the <br>body of the Lord<br>, It is in the very nature of the Self to enjoy being under the service of the Lord. This is said in the [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: \u2018The One who is situated in the Self and pervades it; The One whom the Self does not know; The One whose <br>body is the Self<br>; The One who controls the Self from its core\u2019.<br>And in <br>[shvEtAshvatara], 6-9:<br> He is the Controller of the one who controls the organs. He has no origin, He has no controller. In <br>[shvEtAshvatara], 9-16:<br> He is the owner of both the Self and the environment; The Lord of all qualities.<br>The knowledge in the Self is infinite. It is distinct from the body and not bound by it. As said in <br>[shvEtAshvatara], 5-9:<br> The Self is able to achieve the state of boundlessness. Being bound to a body is the outcome of the actions committed by the Self. When the Self is free from the bonds of action, it <br>reaches infinity<br>. <br>The word <br>[brahma]<br> in this chapter refers to the unbound Self. The word <br>[brahma]<br> is used this way in other Shlokas too - as in Chap.14#26: 'With focused devotion, a person completely overcomes the three qualities and is cut out to <br>[brahmabhUya]<br> \u2013 the experience the Self in its true form\u2019 and in Chap.18#54: 'Having realized the Self, with a serene mind, he doesn't get upset and doesn't yearn.

It is also not the state when the Self is present in the <br>subtle singularity<br>'. <br>When <br>liberated<br>, the Self is not associated with being the cause, nor the effect. The words \u2018cause\u2019 and \u2018effect\u2019 don\u2019t relate to the state of the Self. While interpreting this Shloka, the word '<br>[sat]<br>' is mapped to the state after creation, where things can be distinguished and be named. '<br>[asat]<br>' is the state before creation, when this could not be done. <br>This interpretation is supported by the scriptures:<br>[Anandavalli], 7:<br> '<br>[asat]<br> was the state that existed before all this. Then <br>[sat]<br> was born' and [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7: 'At that time (before creation), this world was undivided. The Lord created the classifications with names and forms'<br>"

So [ashvattha:] means 'that which is not present tomorrow'. When this is used to describe the material world, it illustrates the temporary nature of this world. Yet, this Shloka says it does not wear out. How come? Read on...<br>Several scriptures refer to the material environment as a pepal tree that doesn't wear out, with its roots on top and branches below. The <br>[kaThA upanishat], 6-1<br> says 'With its roots at the top and branches below, this pepal tree is ancient'. <br>[yajur vEda], 1-11-5<br> says 'The person who knows the pepal tree well - with the roots above and branches below - is the one who knows'.<br>Its roots are said to be at the top, since the universe started with Brahma at the top. Brahma is the principal architect who made the universe happen. The various beings of the universe - plants, microbes, birds, animals and so on - are of different types, classified as branches in the tree down below. We can't cut away the flow of material experiences as long as we ignore reality and remain attached. In this way, the tree, representing the material world, does not wear out. <br>The leaves of this pepal tree are said to represent the Vedas. The Vedas specify the methods to achieve material goals like wealth and family. The world grows with these activities - hence the Vedas are like the leaves of this tree. The growth of a tree is due to the nourishment supplied by the leaves. <br>The Vedas themselves specify the method to cut ourselves free from the tree that\u2019s the material world. The person who knows such a pepal tree is the one who knows the Vedas. This person knows the nature of this tree, which must be cut. He also knows the method to cut his attachment to it.

              "The Lord says- I am present at the heart of all beings, the place where the awareness called 'consciousness' comes from. This 'consciousness' is the awareness that brings the experience of pleasantness, initiates the process of digestion and governs all activities that are performed or stopped in all beings. In this way, I am at the core of all beings, regulating everything by My will. The scriptures say the same:<br>[ya.aa], 3-11-2 says - 'He is the core of the Self in everyone, ruling them and pervading them from the inside'.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3 says - 'He who is situated in the earth...'<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22 says - 'He is present in the Self while being distinct from the Self. He rules the Self from the inside'<br>[mahA nArAyaNa]<br> says - 'The heart is like a lotus flower facing downwards. Everything is present within, in a subtle form'.<br>[ChAndOgya], 8-1-1<br> says - 'In this body, which is the Lord's place of residence, there is a small lotus, with a small space. That space is the Lord in subtle form', after which it goes on to describe the qualities of that space - its intent is always fulfilled, it has infinite joy, it has no thirst and so on - these are the qualities of the Lord.<br>In the <br>[viShNu purANa], 1-17-20<br> Prahlada tells his father - 'Vishnu is the ruler of everything in the world, without exception, He pervades everything'. <br>[manu smr'ti], 12-122 says - 'He controls everything, being smaller and subtle beyond anything else'.<br>[manu smr'ti], 8-92 says - 'The Lord, who is the controller and the regulator, is present at your heart'<br>Hence, everyone's memory comes from Me. This 'memory' is the awareness that comes from merely re-living a past experience. Awareness is to infer and recognize things based on experiences from various organs. <br>Forgetfulness and the inability to reason is from Me. The power to reason comes from Me, as well as the ability to anticipate, says the Lord. This comes to us in the form of 'I have learnt this fact (a fact like gravity); I see the situation (like a stone being tossed); I can reason what's next (the stone will fall)'. The chain of events that happens after this (the stone hurting someone) adds to our learning. In this Shloka, The Lord said 'All this comes from Me'. <br>'I alone am to be known from all the Vedas' - The Vedas describe natural phenomena like fire, wind, the Sun, the Moon, acts of nature and so on. I am inside all of them, at the core of their Self. Hence, I am the One to be known from all the Vedas. The words 'human', 'god' and all others refer to the Self in them. The Vedas describe the methods of worshipping the gods, along with the results of such worship. <br>It is the Lord who is being worshipped by all methods, being at the core of every Self.<br>'I make the end of the Vedas' - the Vedas end in the fruits of the actions they prescribed. 'Making the end' here means that the Lord makes the fruits - He is the One who gives the result stated in the Vedas.<br>This was stated previously, starting with Chap.7#21 and Chap.7#22: 'Which ever devotee likes to please what ever form with dedication, I give stability to the same faith in each of them. With that dedication, the person wishes to worship accordingly. By this he attains his desires. These desires are given by Me alone' and in Chap.9#24: 'I am indeed the enjoyer and the single Master of all services rendered to anyone or anything. Those who crave for material wealth do not know Me as I am. Hence, they fall back'.<br>'I am the One who knows the Vedas': All the Vedas describe and address the Lord. The Lord says 'I know this fact'. Those who speak other meanings of the Vedas do not know the Vedas - that is the opinion expressed here.<br>'Hence, listen to the one summary of all the Vedas from Me' - continues the Lord.<br>"

Fear is a discomfort that\u2019s experienced when we imagine the sadness of undesirable happenings- being separated from what we love and being associated with what we hate. The absence of this fear is the characteristic of being 'free from fear'.<br>'A clear mind' comes from focusing the mind inwards, losing attachment to the qualities of <br>rajas<br> and <br>tamas<br>.<br>This person 'Settles in the knowledge of the Self' by dedicating to realize the Self and distinguish it from the environment.<br>'Generosity' is to give away our earnings to those who deserve it.<br>'Control over our organs' comes from the regular practice of bringing the mind away from its pre-occupation with material subjects.<br>'Worship of the Lord' is about doing our duties without attachment to results, purely as worship to please the Lord.<br>The characteristic of 'reciting the scriptures' comes from the awareness that they describe the Lord with all His wealth and power, along with the methods to worship Him.<br>'Dedicating thought into performance' is about performing tough tasks and gaining the ability to please the Lord.<br>'Consistency in thought, speech and action' is to commit the same in thought, speech and action towards others.<br>Being 'intolerant towards violence' is to abandon hurting others.<br>'Satya' is about saying it 'as it is', in a way that's beneficial. This comes from saying what we have come to infer, saying it in a way that's beneficial to all beings.<br>'Freedom from anger' is to free the mind of the deformity that makes a goal out of hurting others.<br>Leaving things that don\u2019t benefit the Self \u2013 is the character of giving up distractions that don't benefit our Self.<br>'Being content with the Self' comes from the practice of restraining our organs from their tendency to go behind material things.<br>The virtue of 'not speaking ill of others' is about restraining statements that cause harm to others.<br>'Compassion towards all beings' comes from not tolerating sorrow in anyone.<br>We are 'without attachments in material subjects' when we don't crave for material experiences, nor do we cling on to them.<br>'Not being harsh' gives eligibility to connect with virtuous people.<br>'Prudence' is about being embarrassed to do things that are not to be done.<br>'Unwavering' is when we don't lose focus even in the presence of distracting attractions.<br>The 'the brilliance of leadership' is to be without subjugation in the face of opposition.<br>'Forgiveness' is to be free of agitation, even when we perceive others inflicting discomfort upon us - without being vindictive towards them.<br>'Resolve' is to affirm with determination \u2013 we do things that are to be done and reject those that are not, even in the face of great obstacles.<br>\u2018Cleanliness' is to tune our external and internal organs to be devoted to the Lord, as instructed by Him in the scriptures.<br>We 'do not work to put another at a disadvantage' when we don't become obstacles to others - when we don't obstruct the expression of their free will.<br>Arrogance is inappropriate pride. Freedom from arrogance is to be without pride when it's not deserved.<br>A person born with the qualities associated with a \u2018deva\u2019 would have the above properties. A \u2018deva\u2019 is one who <br>intends<br> to work according to the Lord's principles. Such a person\u2019s character is to follow the instructions of the Lord. A person 'born into' these characteristics is determined to dedicate his life to these principles. The purpose of such a person's life is to accomplish the above principles as the Lord's command.<br>"

In Chap.18#7, He says - 'It is not appropriate to renounce activities that are prescribed. Getting confused and letting go of them is said to be in laziness, a quality of tamas'. <br>In Chap.18#12, He says - 'Actions have three types of results - desirable, undesirable and mixed.

              "It isn\u2019t appropriate to renounce or give up routine and prescribed activities. These are activities such as eating, breathing and worshipping. <br>As said in Chap.3#8: 'Even the journey through your body wouldn't be achieved when you are inactive' - Don't give up activities in this journey through your body. This journey itself works to gain the knowledge that <br>liberates<br> us, by consuming the balance that remains from worship. Otherwise, as said in Chap.3#13: 'The kleptomaniacs who enjoy the results for their own sake will only experience misfortune'. <br>In this way, when the body is built from food other than the food that is derived from worship, it acts as a contaminant and forms the base of false knowledge. <br>Food nourishes the mind, as said in <br>[chAndOgya], 6-5-4:<br> 'Son, the mind is constituted from the food we eat\u2019. Again, as said in <br>[chandogya], 7-26-2:<br> 'When the food is pure, the mind is not contaminated. A clean mind is capable of strong awareness. All knowledge can be released with the strength of this awareness'. <br>Thus, it is learnt that knowledge to realize the Self rests on the sanctity of the food we consume.<br>That's why it's not appropriate to give up routine, prescribed activities in this journey through the body. Routine activities such as eating and prescribed activities such as worship are meant for knowing the Self. <br>The quality of <br>tamas<br> gives rise to the misconception that these actions are binding in nature - though in reality, such actions actually lead to knowledge that liberates us. When we give up these activities due to such misconceptions, we remain in the quality of <br>tamas<br>. Indeed, the quality of <br>tamas<br> is the source of ignorance. As said in Chap.14#17: 'Mistakes, misconceptions and ignorance come from the quality of <br>tamas<br>'.<br>Ignorance is made from misconceptions that repel knowledge. Further in this chapter, it is said in Chap.18#32: 'People are overwhelmed by the quality of <br>tamas<br> when they understand their duty to be contrary to prescribed actions. Their intentions are born in the quality of <br>tamas<br> and go against any kind of achievement'.<br>In this way, misconceptions result in giving up routine and prescribed activities.<br>"

They perform different functions whenever we do something.<br>The various activities: The word 'activity' here refers to the gases in our body and the activities that happen inside, such as respiration.<br>The Divine: In the field where things are combined into actions, the fifth one is The Divine - It is the Lord who is inside everything, the main cause in bringing actions to effect. As said in Chap.15#15: \u2018I am at the heart of everything\u2019 and in Chap.18#61: 'Arjuna, the Supreme Lord sits at the heart of every being, spinning all beings, mounting them in the mechanism of the environment\u2019. <br>The 'doer-ship' of the Self is completely dependent on the Lord, as said in <br>[vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-40:<br> \u2018\u2026as said in the scriptures, the doer-ship is given by the Supreme Lord'.<br>Whatever the Self does is completely dependent on the Lord. Given this fact, all instructions in the scriptures and everything they forbid would be meaningless if we consider that the Self is not accountable for any action. Vyasa has resolved this dilemma as well, in <br>[vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-41:<br> 'The Lord expects the Self to begin the attempt, so that His instructions in the scriptures retain their use'.<br>In summary: Actions are carried out with organs given by the Lord, having the Lord as the basis, with the strength that's deposited in them by the Lord. The Self has the Lord as the basis of existence as well, with its strength given by the Lord Himself. <br>The Self initiates its attempt to carry out an action according to its will, as per the configuration of its body and associated organs. After that, The Lord inside grants permission to commence the action and sets the Self in motion. In this way, the Self becomes the cause of action as well - by its intent alone.<br>This is similar to activities that require many people and equipment - for example, activities that result in moving a huge boulder or building a bridge. In such activities, many people and machines are considered to be the cause, with each of them having their do's and don'ts. In the same way, this Shloka described the activity brought about by the Self and the Lord.<br>"

The first view is -<br>The second view is -<br>Commentary on the first view:<br>The duties of <br>activity<br>, <br>contemplat<br>ion and <br>devotion<br> are methods to achieve the <br>ultimate goal<br>. Do them with affection towards Me, with My worship as the purpose. Leave the outcomes, possessiveness towards the action and the misconception that you make things happen. <br>Have Me and only Me as the Performer, as the One who is worshipped, as the Goal, and as the Method to achieve the goal. This is what's meant by the phrase 'letting go of everything that is to be achieved', as mentioned in this Shloka and as described in the scriptures.<br>It was thoroughly described in this chapter, starting with Chap.18#4: 'Listen to My clarification of '<br>letting go<br>', which is done in three ways'. Then, Chap.18#9 talked about '<br>letting go<br>' of attachment and outcomes. This is regarded as being in the quality of <br>sattva<br>. <br>It concluded in Chap.18#11: 'Indeed, it's not possible for a person having a body to give up all activity without exception. On the other hand, a person who leaves the outcome of his action is the one who has let-go'.<br>I will free you from all misfortune. Misfortunes prevent you from being with Me. They come from missed duties and misdeeds, committed since beginning-less time. In this Shloka, The Lord says- You let-go in this way, and I shall free you from all misfortune. <br>Don't worry.<br>Commentary on the second view:<br>Devotion to The Lord<br> happens when we adore The Lord, free of all misfortune and its regrets. <br>However, our misfortunes are unending, having collected since beginning-less time. They will come in the way of our <br>devotion<br>. <br>In the limited time we have, it isn't possible to do everything towards redeeming an infinite amount of misfortune. Hence, Arjuna feels sad that he isn't qualified to begin <br>devotion<br>. <br>To remove Arjuna's sorrow, the Lord tells him - 'Let go of every regret and reparation that stands in the way of <br>devotion<br>. Surrender to Me alone'.<br>We have committed all kinds of deeds since beginning-less time. We accumulate misfortune when we commit misdeeds or when we miss our duties. In this way, all of us have accumulated a great variety of unlimited misfortune. All this comes in the way of <br>devotion<br>. <br>We need to make a lot of amends and reparations to get rid of all our misfortune. Since we have a limited lifespan, it isn\u2019t possible to make enough reparations. <br>That's why The Lord says - Let go of all these regrets that are impossible to repair, which stand in the way of <br>devotion<br>. Surrender to Me alone - I am ultimately compassionate, I don't consider anyone to be peculiar, I am the refuge of everyone without exception, I am an ocean of affection to those who take refuge in Me. I shall free you from every misfortune that comes in the way of practicing <br>devotion<br>, as I've stated. <br>Don't worry.<br>"

By Your grace itself, this awareness has been grasped by me'.<br>Delusion is to believe that I am my body, without recognizing the Self. <br>Awareness is to know and recognize that everything - be it conscious or non-conscious - exists as the Lord's body - He is the Self in everything. <br>Delusion is to consider existence, without having the Lord as the Self in everything. <br>Awareness is to recognize that our routine activities and prescribed duties are the Lord's worship. We achieve the Lord by performing those activities and duties. Believing them to be binding in nature is delusion. Such delusion is gone now.<br>The Self is distinct from the environment and doesn't carry any characteristic of the environment. Its only characteristic is the ability to know. It exists for the purpose of the Lord alone. Being governed by the Lord is its natural state of being.<br>The Lord has the creation, sustenance and the destruction of the entire universe as His sport. <br>He repels all flaws without exception. His form is purely gratifying. <br>By His very nature, He is a great ocean of unbroken, unlimited knowledge, strength, wealth, valor, power, luster and other such favorable characteristics. <br>He is known as <br>[parabrahma]<br> - the supreme expanse. 'Awareness' is such knowledge of The Lord in His true form. <br>Arjuna says - 'I have attained knowledge in this form - I now know the true characteristics of the Supreme Being. I know the distinction between this Supreme Being and the rest. <br>I will end up adoring the Lord by practicing my routine and prescribed activities, having Him as my only purpose - even in the resolution of guilt. Then, with equanimity and self-control, I experience bliss in the characteristics of the Self. This gains the form of devotion. <br>The Supreme Lord, who is the subject of all the Vedanta, can only be attained by the worship of the Supreme Lord.<br>I know that You, the son of Vasudeva, are the Supreme Lord.<br>Moreover, I'm free of the exhaustion, which was caused by delusion. That delusion was fueled by feelings of pity and affection towards relatives. I now stand fit. I will do as you say right now, in war and in all other ways. I shall fight'.<br>Next, Sanjaya answers Dhrtarashtra, who had asked what his sons and the Pandava were doing in battle.<br>"
