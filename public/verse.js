Bhishma also got others in his army to utter sounds of victory.<br>On the other side, Krishna - The Lord of lords, the Master of everything, who was Arjuna's charioteer, and Arjuna himself, seated in a special chariot qualified to conquer all worlds, blew their conches- Panchajanya and Devadatta.

            "Sanjaya said - <br>Arjuna is a person with a great mind. He is extremely sympathetic and maintains firm bonds of friendship. He is righteous and has similar-minded brothers. He was cheated by you (Dhritarashtra) many times by terrible acts - such as lodging them in a house of wax and setting fire to it. Arjuna has the Lord himself as his support. Having seen your people who were to be slain in battle, he was overcome by friendship, sympathy, fear of righteous and unrighteous behavior. He lost strength in his organs and said \u2018I will never wage war\u2019. Then, overcome by sadness at the sight of his relatives to be treated as his opponents, he threw away the bow and arrow. He sat on the edge of his chariot."

If the Lord were to be the only real entity without any attributes, unchanged and permanent, ignorance doesn't happen. <br>So, the Lord's statement that we are many and are distinct from the Lord couldn't have been made in ignorance. <br>What if knowledge and ignorance coexist in the Lord, who remains unaffected by that ignorance? The analogy given to illustrate this possibility is that of a burnt piece of cloth or paper, left undisturbed. Though it may have retained its shape, it doesn't have its original function. However, this doesn't hold either. For example, a mirage makes the illusion of water. <br>However, once we know that a mirage can do that, we will not reach out to fetch water from it or\u00a0initiate any action based upon such an illusion again. In the same way, if all distinctions were due to ignorance and such ignorance was resolved, there wouldn't be a situation in which the Lord would explain these distinctions to Arjuna. <br>There's no possibility of the Lord being under the influence of ignorance at some point in the past, as mentioned in the scriptures:[mundakOpanishat], 1-2-6 says: He is aware of everything and knows everything.<br>[shvEtAshvatara], 6-8 says: The Lord's strength is described in many ways. Such strength is His by nature, along with knowledge, strength and His activities. <br>In Chap.7#26, the Lord says: I know the beings whose time has passed, who are present now and those who will be in the future. However, there isn't anyone who knows Me.<br>If indeed the Lord is the only one and the rest are imaginary, the Lord would know that and so would the people He teaches. Then whom will the Lord teach that there is only one? Everyone else would be imaginary.<br>What if there is only one and it appears multiple - like reflections? Arjuna, receiving the teaching, is like a reflection of the Lord. Any sane person wouldn't look at his own reflection on a shining surface and clarify these distinctions to it.<br>What if the Lord has the knowledge and is still limited by past ignorance? That doesn't hold either, let\u2019s see why. <br>Having knowledge and still being limited can be illustrated with an analogy - Suppose there is someone who sees two moons due to a defect in his vision. Even after he knows that there's only one moon, he can still see two moons. However, the defect in his sight doesn't cause any harm anymore. <br>This analogy doesn't hold in case of Krishna. There's no possibility of any defect returning. If at all a teacher has the complete knowledge that there is indeed a single Lord and nothing else is real, there's no possibility for him to explain anything to anyone - because they don't exist. If the teacher doesn't have such complete knowledge,\u00a0he cannot teach anyway. If the teacher is imaginary, then his teachings are also imaginary. If the purpose of the teaching was to get rid of ignorance, it applies to the teachers as well. If at all these distinctions are due to ignorance and if the teacher is free of such \u2018ignorance\u2019, whom will he teach?"

The concepts of coming into being and ceasing to exist do not apply to the Self.<br>It means the Self has not come into being at the time of creation (at the beginning of the kalpa), nor will it cease to exist at the time of destruction. Brahma, the principal engineer of the universe, is born and will eventually die. So do all the other great powers. Even in them, birth and death do not affect the Self. <br>In this way, the Self in each body is without birth. It is everlasting, doesn\u2019t get destroyed and isn\u2019t related to the unending series of cause-effect changes in the environment. Though ancient, the Self still seems to be new.

            "The destruction of anything that's born is certain - This inevitability is evident. <br>Also, it is inevitable that something that has been destroyed comes into existence. How is it possible, that something that has been destroyed is born again? To answer the question, consider this: For things that are perceived to exist, their creation is evident. For things that don\u2019t seem to exist, it\u2019s not evident. Terms like creation and destruction describe different states of an object that has existence. <br>As an analogy, things that do exist, such as threads, when put together, form something that\u2019s called cloth. The same thing applies even to things that don't seem to exist - The thread changed its context, it did not cease to exist.<br>When things like clothes are created, nothing else is observed, except that threads are put together in a pattern. Merely by a transaction, or by using a different name, or by using it for a different purpose, the thought that new matter has been created is not appropriate. Thus, things like creation and destruction are different states of an existing object. <br>'Destruction' is said to happen when an object, which is in the state called 'created', obtains a state that seems opposite to its created state. For example, mud can exist in different states such as 'dough-like-mass', as a 'pot', as \u2018pieces\u2019 and as \u2018powder\u2019. <br>In the same manner, any object that\u2019s affected by its environment inevitably undergoes a series of transformations. For an object that exists in a certain state, obtaining the next state is its destruction. For the object in the succeeding state, obtaining that state itself is its creation. Thus, it\u2019s inevitable that any object that's affected by its environment undergoes a series of creations and destructions: There is no need to feel sorry about this.<br>Even the slightest sorrow that may arise on seeing an object change from one state to another does not arise in the case of humans and other beings \u2013 The Lord states that next."

The determination is to ascertain the true nature of the Self. <br>On the other hand, actions that are driven by desires are without such resolve. When we are driven by desires, it's just beneficial to know the distinction between the body and the Self. It\u2019s not necessary to realize the true nature of the Self.

A person who has the determination to achieve liberation would initiate all activity for the one end-result called moksha. Hence, given the same wisdom behind these activities, there is a single intent that drives all the actions. <br>As an analogy, take the intention to make money for the sake of money itself. There may be many different activities that can make money. The wisdom driving those activities is the practical awareness of capital. The intention behind all those activities is the same.<br>People without the determination to achieve liberation are ruled by actions to achieve various outcomes, such as children, wealth, food or a place in heaven. Due to the countless variety of outcomes, the intentions that drive those actions are uncountable as well. Also, they branch out variously in the form of differences and side-effect within the same goal.

Their minds will never have the knowledge required for carrying out actions that lead to moksha- actions which lead to the true nature of the Self.<br>Hence, a person who desires moksha must not associate with desire-driven actions.<br>Now, some questions arise: The Vedas deal with the science of your Self with an affection that\u2019s greater than thousands of parents. Why is it that the Vedas also preach actions that yield minor enjoyments, which further the cycle of re-birth? Is it appropriate to say that the outcomes prescribed in the Vedas are to be given up? Answers to these questions come in the following Shlokas:"

Desire is a state in which a person is unable to stay without experiencing things that stimulate the sense organs. <br>From this desire, anger is born. There will be a time when a person is denied something he desires. Then, he feels that others are responsible and throws his anger at them.

Due to loss of such understanding, the intellect perishes. <br>The focus that he brought about to gain realization of the Self is destroyed. Due to the loss of such intellect, he falls back to material things and is wasted."

It also gives the knowledge required to work without attachments. The aim of this knowledge is to be firm in wisdom."

I described the two types of practices- knowledge and action- without any mix-up: These two practices are to be followed by people who are qualified to perform them. Indeed, not everyone who desires moksha is directly qualified to pursue the knowledge of the Self. <br>However, everyone is definitely entitled to work without attachments, doing it as My service. They get rid of their flaws by performing such actions. Their organs lose all their agitation. Then, they qualify to realize the Self."

This technique is called [jnAnayOga]. It is for people who can reason out the knowledge of the Self through their intellect alone. People with such focused intellect are called [sAnkhyA:]. The word [sankhyA] means intellect. These people can focus on the knowledge of the Self alone without wavering.<br>In summary: People are always entitled to do their work without being driven by desire \u2013 even people whose intellect is still turned by material objects.

            "Do your activities to realize your Self \u2013 instead of having your attachments agitate you.",
            "The word [niyatam] is used here to mean 'invariably accompanied with'. Everyone who is associated with matter is invariably accompanied by activity. Such is the relation between the person and activity. Thus, activity is certainly available to everyone, due to the influence of innumerable actions committed in the past. Activity is easy and isn\u2019t associated with the danger of ignorance. Hence, certainly perform action. <br>The word \u2018inactivity\u2019 is used here to mean 'the mere practice of contemplation without involving our organs in action'- see (Chap.3#4), where it says \u2018By avoiding actions, a person cannot get rid of the influence of his past deeds\u2019. Definitely, action is better than mere contemplation on the Self.<br>Even for a person who is able to contemplate on the Self as an intellectual activity, the pursuit is extremely difficult - that\u2019s because he does not have the experience of being inactive. It isn\u2019t possible to control this method. This pursuit is also associated with the danger of falling into ignorance. <br>Hence, being with activity is definitely better than merely striving for knowledge.<br>While imparting the knowledge of the Self in its true form, it is explained later (Chap.5#14) that the Self is not the doer when we perform an action \u2013 by its very nature, it doesn\u2019t make the outcome happen. Thus, the knowledge about the true nature of the Self is included inside actions that are performed without attachment to outcomes. In this way, these actions are superior.<br>The statement that activity is superior to inaction holds true indeed, even for a person who is able to focus on the Self. Suppose this person were to give up all activity, pursuing the knowledge of the Self alone. That\u2019s not entirely possible since the practice of contemplation itself happens as an activity inside his body and that is definitely not inactive. <br>Till the realization of the Self is complete, you need to be associated with a body.<br>Worship the Lord with wealth accumulated through just means. Conduct your journey in this life inside your body, with the balance coming from this worship. In the [ChAndOgya upanishad] (7-26-2), it is said- \u2018If what we eat is pure, the content of our body will be pure. When the content is pure, our consciousness is firm\u2018. Further on, in (Chap.3-13), it is said: \u2018The person who cooks for his own sake will suffer guilt\u2019. <br>Thus, even if an intellectual in the pursuit of the Self wanted to avoid activity, the journey through the life of his body would be impossible without any activity. This person needs to perform worship and other duties, till his goal of realizing the Self is met.<br>The realization of the Self comes from working without being driven by outcomes - by knowing the fact that the Self is not the doer. The ability to work is provided readily by nature- it is easily available. In summary, working without being driven by outcomes is superior, even for a person who is able to meditate on the Self as a purely intellectual activity.<br>Hence, without doubt, work without being driven by outcomes."

            "Often, our activities themselves cause agitation, don\u2019t they?",
            "Next, a question: If this is indeed so and we need to be in action, accumulating wealth and so on, the accumulation of wealth would be associated with the feeling that 'I am the cause' and 'This is mine'. Such feelings cause our organs to be agitated and we fall back under the influence of our past deeds. Isn't that so? The next Shloka answers this question."

The Lord created everything for his own enjoyment. Hence, anything that happens in the environment is for His pleasure and is a method of worship - including sunshine, rain, the growth of food, nourishment and so on.<br>All living beings survive by consuming food. Food is created using rain water- this fact is known to everyone. The fact that rain water is a result of a method of worship is stated in the scriptures such as [brahma purANa], 16-4: 'The Sun has fuel that burns. Rain happens due to the Sun'. "

            "Activity happens in the environment, not for our purpose. The Self must engage in worship.",
            "Any method of worship results from activity. An example of such activity is to earn or acquire materials. This activity pans out in a series of transactions involving all things that make the activity happen.<br>Activity happens in the environment. In this Shloka, the word [brahma] is used to denote the body, which is a contribution of nature. Our environment is an attribute of the Lord, as said in [muMDaka], 1-1-16: \u2018The environment, along with all things that are distinguishable in it arise from the Supreme Lord\u2019. Also, in (Chap.14#3), it is said \u2018the entire universe is my womb\u2019. <br>The word [akShara] in this Shloka denotes the Self. This Self, being satisfied with food and water, instructs the body to work. In this way, the body is the vehicle of activity. This possibility arises in the presence of the Self.<br>In summary, all actions relate to the body and are enabled by the Self. The Self must engage in worship. Worship is the origin of all actions. <br>The cycle kept in motion by the Lord runs like this: Bodies of conscious beings comes from food; Food comes due to rain; Rain results from a method of worship; Worship results from activity, put together by the transactions of the doers; activity comes from bodies of conscious beings. The bodies come from food - This is the cycle, which runs in the form of a cause-and-effect chain.<br>People who do not acknowledge and follow this cycle while actually being in it earn a lot of guilt. They don\u2019t nurture their bodies with the residue of worship. They spend a lifetime gathering and finding fault. These people continue to look for contentment in the sense organs. They do not look for contentment in the Self. Sense organs restrict their field of play. <br>With the body and mind nurtured by things other than the residue of worship, the properties of rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance) are abundant. They are turned away from the realization of the Self and immerse themselves in experiencing material things alone. This applies to those who are able to contemplate, as well as to the rest who are eligible to work without being driven by outcomes.<br>In this way, they are said to waste away life without achieving moksha, even while focusing their thoughts on the Self.<br>The next Shloka explains that only a truly free person isn\u2019t bound to initiate any actions. Such a person can see his Self without the need to achieve or strive for anything."

This person naturally revels in the Self, is inclined towards the Self and is satisfied by the Self; not by other things like food or entertainment; he isn\u2019t arrogant because he knows the Self, or because he works without attachment. His refuge, nourishment and consumption are all in the Self alone.<br>Due to this, anything done by him for the purpose of achieving the Self is of no added benefit. If he stays without doing anything to achieve the Self, there is no loss- he can see the Self without any effort or strife. Being disinterested in anything other than the Self, he does not have a dependency in the form of \u2018this is useful to me\u2019, towards any inanimate object. He does not need to do anything to achieve this independence. He is truly free.<br>He does not indulge in accomplishments, since he does not need any accomplishment to realize the Self. Even for those who are involved in accomplishing things, the best action is [karmayOga] - working without attachment towards its outcome. It's easy to practice, is free of fault and has the knowledge of the Self embedded in it.<br>Due to this reason, keep working without any attachment until the Self is realized. Consider your action merely as a duty - 'something to be done'. The person who practices this form of action - without believing that he is the cause of the outcome - will attain the supreme goal (moksha) and realize the Self."

Hence, consider Me as the trigger of all activity. Offer your activities completely to Me, the Supreme Lord. Do those activities as a means to worship Me alone. Do not desire other outcomes.

In this way, it was passed on from generation to generation.

I have taught you this very method in detail. I taught this due to your friendship, due to your devotion and due to the fact that you surrendered and approached me.<br>It's not possible for anyone other than Me to know this method and speak about it, since it is knowledge of the highest order.

            "Arjuna asks- Going by the passage of time, Your birth is recent, in the same period as the rest of us. The birth of Vivasvan happened a long time ago- 28 sets of four-yugas ago, as calculated by the records. <br>Yuga is a period of time. There are four yugas: [kr`ta] or [satya] with 1,728,000 years, [trEta] with 1,296,000 years, [dvApara] with 864,000 years and [kali] with 432,000 years.<br>A kalpa is 14 sets of 71 yuga-cycles, or 4.3 billion years.<br>The statement that you were indeed the person who spoke at the beginning of this period sounds impossible. How can I grasp this fact in its real sense?Of course, it can be explained that the Lord spoke to Vivasvan in some other birth. Great people can remember their deeds from a previous birth. So, there is no impossibility or contradiction over here. Moreover, while conversing, it's not that Arjuna was unaware of Krishna being the Lord of the universe. In fact, Arjuna himself says \u2018You are the ultimate creator, the ultimate refuge and the ultimate in purity. You are a person who is eternal, divine, the ultimate master- this has been told by all the sages including Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You have told me the same.\u2019 (See Chap.10#4 to Chap.10#13).<br>In Yudhishthira\u2019s Rajasuya, Bhishma and others proclaimed again and again: \u2018Krishna himself is the ultimate cause for the creation and destruction of the universe. All the conscious and unconscious beings exist for Krishna's purpose only ([bhArata. sabhA]. 38-26)This means the whole world is under Krishna's control.<br>Arjuna's question can be detailed this way- Arjuna knows that the son of Vasudeva is indeed the Lord. Yet, he asks as though he doesn\u2019t know. <br>This is the clarification he seeks: Is the birth of the Lord in human form an illusion? "

His purpose is always fulfilled and He has everything He desires. He has now been born among mortals, who are bound to their actions. Is this birth real? If so, what is the nature of this birth? What constitutes the body that is born? What's the cause of this birth? When is this birth going to happen? What's the goal of such a birth?Arjuna sought clarifications to all these doubts with his question."

The reason for differentiation among various beings (like gods, humans, animals) is the influence of their past deeds.

The act of creation also does not stick to him as something that He has done. Nothing here contradicts the fact that He is the Lord of everything and controls everything. It\u2019s just that He does not exercise his control indiscriminately. He permits things to happen according to the influence of the past deeds of a conscious being."

            "The firm belief that all actions have the Lord as their basis, that all actions are pervaded by the Lord is explained here.<br>Every time we work, we intend to make a contribution to others or to ourselves. For the explanation here, consider our activity to be analogous to making a contribution or offering to the fire.<br>While making an offering during worship, the contribution is being offered to the Lord. The ladle that is used to make the offering is the implement which helps us in our work. By virtue of being a work of the Lord, it is the same as the Lord. The ladle used in contributing the offering to the Lord is itself pervaded by the Lord.<br>In this way, the contribution, the tool used in the work, the fire into which the contribution is made and the doer himself \u2013 all these are pervaded by the Lord. In this way, all actions have the Lord embedded in them.<br>The person who firmly believes that all actions are pervaded by the Lord will certainly reach the Lord. He will gain the knowledge of the Self with the Lord embedded in it \u2013 The Self that\u2019s pervaded by the Lord.<br>In summary, a person who desires moksha works with the firm belief that every activity is pervaded by the Lord. With this belief, his activity leads him to realize the true nature of the Self. This will lead the person to know the Self without needing an exclusive pursuit of knowledge.<br>In this way, after teaching the knowledge that\u2019s embedded in activity, The Lord goes ahead to describe the different methods of working without being driven by outcomes.<br>The translation here has made a few interpretations. <br>[brahmakArya] in the commentary has been translated to \u2018work of the Lord\u2019, which could either mean \u2018The Lord is the cause of it\u2019, or it could mean \u2018being performed for the Lord\u2019. Though they mean two different things, both are valid meanings. Also, phrases like [tat brahma] \u2013 \u2018it is the Lord\u2019 \u2013 have been translated to \u2018it is the same as the Lord\u2019. While reading this, equate it to \u2018being pervaded by the Lord\u2019. Of course, the whole universe is pervaded by the Lord. This firm belief while working will lead us to realize the Self and reach the Lord."

All these are methods to worship using material things.<br>Yet others practice devotion through penance- for example, by fasting in various ways. Some do it by reaching a certain destination\u2013 a place of worship (The word [yOga] is used in this Shloka to indicate this particular variety of karmayOga, accomplished by reaching a place of worship). Some of them apply themselves to a study of the scriptures, while some focus on realizing the meaning contained in there.<br>All of them are dedicated people. They are said to have firm focus."

Among these, the form that is full of knowledge is by far the more significant. Every activity culminates in knowledge, along with everything else that\u2019s included in it.<br>The phrase \u2018everything else\u2019 in the commentary here includes all the happenings and experiences that we receive with activity.<br>This knowledge is available in all endeavors. Practice and recognize it in all activity. When it is practiced in this way, in time, it will lead us to the ultimate goal of Moksha."

You will not get deluded after knowing the true nature of the Self.<br>With this knowledge, you will see all beings\u2013 including those we call as humans and gods\u2013 within your Self. That\u2019s because all beings, when detached from the material environment, have a form that consists of knowledge alone. That includes you. In this way, all beings are equivalent. The nature of the Self is always the same when it is freed from the limitations of associating with the environment. This fact is stated again in (Chap.5#19): \u2018Freed from all these limitations, the Self is equivalent in nature to the Lord. Hence, they are situated within the Lord\u2019.<br>In this way, you will see all beings in Me without any exception. Due to the fact that the Self in each being is equivalent in nature to the Lord, it is totally flawless, as said in (Chap14#2): \u2018Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics\u2019.<br>It is also stated in [muMDaka upanishad 3-1-3]: \u2018Having gained this knowledge, a person will give up his good and bad deeds, become flawless and achieve the ultimate equality\u2019. In this way, the various scriptures illustrate that the Self, when freed from everything that has a name, attains a form that\u2019s equivalent to the Lord.<br>When freed from the material environment, the Self in every being is alike and equivalent in nature to the Lord."

The non-uniform effects of nature result in the variety of beings that we see. These cannot indicate that a different form of the Self exists in everyone.

The word \u2018omnipresent\u2019 has been used to describe the Self over here, meaning that the Self is not confined to a certain space. Being confined in a body, or having various relationships (either good or bad) is not a part of its natural state. All this is made up by notions created out of past deeds. "

            "How did these notions, which drive against the basic nature of the Self, come into being? The answer has been stated in this Shloka: \u2018The inherent knowledge in the Self is concealed by ignorance\u2019. What this sentence says is: We're constrained to experience the results of our actions, because the knowledge inherent within the Self is concealed by the influence of our actions \u2013 which we have committed since ancient times. This influence is unfavorable to the realization of the Self. In this way, the true nature of the Self - a form that is pure and infinite knowledge, is concealed by the influence of ancient actions committed by us.<br>Due to this influence, it gets associated with a particular body at a given point in time, resulting in mistaken notions about the Self. We derive perceptions, judgements and desires out of the results of our actions, in line with these mistaken notions about ourselves. Due to these notions, an impression of the Self arises, which is not at all our inherent nature. From that, the deeds that we commit arise \u2013 these are driven by our desires and they add on to the influence of our ancient actions.<br>Next, the Lord links up the statements in Chap.4#36 (\u2018You will cross over all the misery by the boat of knowledge alone\u2019), Chap.4#37 (\u2018In the same way, the fire of knowledge will burn down all your past actions\u2019), Chap.4#38 (\u2018There is nothing in this world, which is equal to knowledge in its flawlessness\u2019) and praises the appropriateness of the message contained in them."

Given the variety it has encountered, I do not see a way in which the mind can be stationed firmly in the idea of equality.<br>The idea of equality was illustrated by You as the universal equivalence of all beings- All of them have a form that is pure knowledge and are equivalent to the Lord\u2019s form, when they are not under the influence of their past deeds. <br>However, the mind has seen a wide variety of humans and other beings. The mind is accustomed to reacting to the various stimuli of the environment incessantly and is inherently volatile. Its entire experience goes against this equivalence. Hence, it is not possible for a person to make it stand in one place. <br>This mind will divert the person by force and firmly drive him elsewhere. Even among the stimuli he is used to, the mind cannot stay at one thought \u2013 it keeps wandering. Moreover, the Self has qualities that are opposite to the usual stimuli experienced by the mind. <br>Given all this, an attempt to make it stand still in the Self is like controlling an unfavorable strong wind with a small fan. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible.<br>In this way, a desire to know the means to control the mind is expressed."

            "Lord Krishna replies- No doubt, the mind is difficult to control. It wanders constantly by its very nature. Even then, it can be brought under control by the excellence of the Self \u2013 which results from the practice of its pure form and qualities. <br>Moreover, attachment to things other than the Self leads to bondage. With this awareness, we get rid of the thirst for various desires. With this and a little effort from the intellect, the mind can be brought under our grip. <br>The pursuit of the Self is indeed impossible \u2013 even with very heavy effort \u2013 if the mind is not under control. A person needs to bring his mind under control, persevering by the methods described before- being aware of the Self, working independent of desire to worship Me. <br>With this, he gains the ability to practice yoga. He gains the ability to see everything with equanimity.<br>Next, Arjuna requests to understand the greatness of yoga in its true nature, in the manner described in Chap.2#40: \u2018While working without attachment towards outcomes, something that has been started is not destroyed\u2019. Over there, The Lord stated that the preferred means to realization is the technique of working without being driven. The knowledge of the Self is embedded in it. This greatness is the same as the special state of being described in this chapter."

On the other, he is not interested in being driven by the usual pleasures and goals of this world. He is also not interested in the outcome of his actions. He doesn\u2019t seem to thrive in achieving material goals.<br>In this way, it appears that he has no base to rest upon. Having proceeded on the path of realizing the Self, he has slipped and fallen.

            "We spoke about realizing the Self within us. What about its intimacy with the Lord?",
            "In this Shloka, the Lord says that the people described till now pale in comparison with a person who surrenders to Him. This person is not one among them; he\u2019s in a different league.<br>To understand this commentary, it is necessary to know the usage of the various grammatical cases. The [panchamI] case means \u2018in comparison to\u2019, which denotes that the subject is distinct from the objects being compared. The [ShaShThI] case means \u2018among\u2019, which means the subject is one among the objects mentioned. In this Shloka, the person being described is different from others. We must pick up the \u2018in comparison to\u2019 case, not the \u2018one among the others\u2019 case.<br>The Shloka describes a person, different from all others who persevere to realize the Self. This description uses the ablative case (which means a comparison and separation \u2013 the [panchami vibhakti]) to denote all the others. <br>People who persevere to realize the Self were described at progressive stages of maturity, starting with Chap.6#26 till Chap.6#30. The person who is going to be described now is distinct from all these four types. <br>The genitive case (denoting \u2018belongingness\u2019 \u2013 the [ShaShThI vibhakti]) is not used, since this person is not merely a special one among others. The phrase \u2018even in comparison to all those who persevere to realize the Self\u2019 has been used in this Shloka. The word \u2018all\u2019 over here includes the people who perform penance and the others mentioned previously (Chap.4#28). Even here, the [panchamI] case is to be grasped, by the same logic mentioned before- the practitioner who is going to be described now has focused his mind the most. He is distinct in comparison to all those people.<br>In comparison to this person, the distinction between people mentioned previously (Chap.4#28) is insignificant. It is like comparing a fabulous mountain in the Himalaya and a minute mustard seed. Even though the mustard seeds have a perceptible difference and inequality among themselves, their insignificance is obvious when placed in perspective with the mountain.<br>This person has placed himself in Me by extreme affection and with the conviction that there is no protector other than Me. This person worships Me with strong intent and a sense of urgency to attain me, since he cannot tolerate even a moment of separation from Me \u2013 again, by an overload of affection towards Me. <br>\u2018Me\u2019 refers to Lord Krishna, whose playing field is the creation, evolution and destruction of the entire universe, which is endowed with a variety of things that are to be experienced, various species of beings that experience it, things that help in experiencing it and places where it can be experienced. <br>This is The Lord, whom no flaw can influence, who is an abode of unlimited amount of great knowledge, power, wealth, courage, strength, brilliance and uncountable other auspicious qualities, whose form is exactly the way He wishes, a form that is unthinkable in its entirety \u2013 divine, extraordinary, eternal, flawless, with limitless brilliance, beauty, aroma, tenderness, charm, youthfulness and is an abode to infinite such qualities. <br>His form and nature cannot be broken-down and understood either through speech or thought. He is a vast ocean of compassion, character, affection, generosity and protects all beings of the universe without exception, without regard to any of their peculiarities. <br>He takes away the pain from anyone who bows and submits to Him. He is a sea of affection to them. He is not visible to any human and never moves away from his true nature. <br>This is Krishna, who has taken birth in the house of Vasudeva, who brightens the world with his continuous and unsurpassed brilliance, who fills the universe with his splendor \u2013 is the kind of Lord worshipped by this person.<br>Lord Krishna concludes this chapter- I, the Lord who always brings everything everywhere into realization in its true form, consider this person to be the most focused, the best of the best among all beings."

At the time of its destruction, it comes back to rest in Me. It is sustained in Me alone. It is situated as though it were My body, having Me as its owner. <br>In this way, I am present as all different things in this universe - as the cause and origin, as well as the resulting manifestation.<br>In this way, I am the basis of existence and the controller. I have unbounded knowledge and count-less other favorable qualities. I am above and beyond in all ways. There is nobody else who is beyond My auspicious qualities. Situated in this way, having unique favorable qualities and ways to enjoy them, I am above all thoughts and feelings that are pervaded by the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. <br>Here, the phrase 'I am above all thoughts and feelings' means that the Lord is beyond those qualities, without being worn out by them, always having an undisturbed, constant form.<br>This entire universe is deluded by material things that are pervaded by the three qualities. These material things are very unpleasant and short-lived. They exist to be experienced by our body and sense organs in accordance with past deeds. Being deluded in this way, the world, with its gods, animals, humans and inanimate things, does not know Me.<br>Now comes the question: With You (the Lord) being ever-present, being superior to all material enjoyments by Your very nature, being with uninterrupted joy in large amounts, with an eternal and undisturbed form, how come every conscious being intends to enjoy the limited pleasures of the material world? Especially considering that material experiences are pervaded by the three qualities, are short-lived and are very unpleasant?"

Know the person who owns this [mAyA] as the Lord'. In this way, it is pervaded by the three qualities, creates our experiences and belongs to the Lord.

            "This surrender, which precedes the joy of being in the service the Lord and the joy of knowing the true Self, is not the result of a small number of virtuous births. Indeed, at the conclusion of many virtuous births, a person comes to know that his primary source of joy is in being of service to Lord Krishna alone. <br>From that point onwards, he comes to know about his own nature, state of being and his activities. He gains knowledge that the Lord is greater than all the countless great qualities put together.<br>Having gained such knowledge, he believes - 'Lord Krishna is the ultimate goal. He is also the means to arrive at that goal. Though there are many other desires, the Lord Himself is all of that' - With this conviction, he surrenders to Me and dedicates himself to My service. This is a great person. Such people are hard to find in this world.<br>This is indeed the meaning of the phrase 'Lord Vasudeva is everything' \u2013 Starting with Chap7#17 'I am dear to this knowledgeable person, in a way that is definitely beyond description' and Chap7#18 'Keeping Me in his thoughts always, he considers Me as the ultimate achievement and takes refuge in Me'. These Shlokas gave the description of the one who knows.<br>The fact that all conscious and non-conscious beings are two natures of the Lord and exist in His service was illustrated starting with Chap7#4: 'This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: The solids, liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the concept of individuality' and in Chap7#5 'Know My ultimate nature as being distinct from this universe - know My ultimate form as a conscious being by whom all this is sustained'Further, the dependence of these two natures on the Lord was described, along with the dependence of all causes and effects, their form, state of existence and their activities. This was stated starting with the Shloka in Chap7#6 'I am the creator and the destroyer of the entire universe', going on to Chap7#7 'There is absolutely nothing else that is superior to Me' till Chap7#12  'Know that all these feelings, with the three qualities being prominent in them, originate from Me. However, I am not bound in them. They are situated in Me' - These Shlokas established the supremacy of the Lord in all ways and the dependence of everything on Him.<br>The person who knows all this is termed as 'the one who knows'.<br>Again, the Lord emphasizes that the one who knows - the type of person described above - is very rare."

They\u2019re the ones that desire wealth and those who know Me along with My effects - effects that are observed to come from materials, as well as the effect of various forces of nature. <br>Though this statement looks like a fact, it\u2019s actually a mandate - the three types of people who worship the Lord must know that The Lord is above all worship. It means the methods of worship apply to all the three types. All of them need to do their routine and prescribed activities. They do it for the Lord\u2019s purpose in His refuge. This is inevitable. <br>The Lord states- At the time of leaving their body, all of them will know Me in-line with their aspiration. <br>The word 'too' says that the people described in the previous Shloka - who are curious to realize the Self, free from infirmity and death - will also know me at the time leaving this world. <br>This statement applies to those who know as well. These people know The Lord as the purpose of all worship. They will also know me at the time of leaving this world, according to their aspiration. Their aspiration is to have their Self attain Me. They attain Me."

            "The entire material creation, which is to be known by people who yearn for wealth, is experienced to wear out. It is in the nature of material things - everything eventually wears out. This effect resides in stimuli such as sound and touch as well. The various sounds, touch, beauty, taste and smells are sought by people who yearn for wealth. Such people yearn for these stimuli, along with the things that stimulate. <br>The 'divine agent' is the supreme person - the one who is above all powers, the one who is the real enjoyer of all experiences. People who yearn for wealth must be in the quest of this state of enjoyment.<br>The purpose of all work and worship is Me. I am the one who is gratified by worship. I am situated as the basis of everyone's Self and they are like My body. In this way, I am the one who is served when people gratify anyone by worship. The three types of worshippers must keep this in mind, while performing various forms of worship."

            "This too, applies to each of the three types of worshippers. At the end of a life-time, the person who gives up his body and passes away while thinking exclusively of Me, will attain My status. Here, the phrase 'My status' refers to the nature of the Lord. At the end of a life-time, a person achieves the form that he focuses on. For instance, as illustrated in the scriptures, a person who thought about a deer at the time of death is born in the body of a deer.<br>The next Shloka describes this very fact unambiguously - the nature of the final thought is such that the thinker is re-born in the same form as the thought."

            "There is a great variety of beings in this universe \u2013 humans, other creatures, right up to Brahma, the engineer of the universe. The arrangement of day and night for various beings is different. People who are aware of this would know that one day of Brahma lasts a thousand four-yuga periods. The duration of the night is similar to the day. It is so by My intent. <br>When such a day of Brahma arrives, everything in this world - the environment, bodies and organs, things that are to be experienced, the different individuals that experience them - come into being from an imperceptible state, which is situated in the body of Brahma.<br>In this imperceptible state, they cannot be distinguished as individuals. The word [avyakta] means 'imperceptible', 'a state of being indistinct'.<br>When the following night arrives, they dissolve into the same indistinct state inside the body of Brahma - they cease to be perceptible individuals. <br>The very same ecosystem of individuals comes into being repeatedly when the day arrives - an inevitable consequence of the deeds they committed in the past. They dissolve and become imperceptible at nightfall. They become perceptible again when the day arrives. <br>After the passage of 100 years consisting of such days and nights, which to humans means the passage of several thousand yuga, all worlds dissolve into Me, including the world of the principal engineer Brahma, including all individuals, including Brahma himself - as said in [subAla.2]: 'Solids dissolve in liquids, the liquids dissolve into energy'Thus, the world dissolves into an imperceptible state, all the way till the indestructible and the invisible. It finally dissolves into Me alone.<br>In this way, everything other than Me is inevitably born and destroyed in a time-bound manner. It implies that those who yearn for wealth inevitably return again and again. On the other hand, those who have approached and achieved Me aren\u2019t forced into this cycle of inevitable return.<br>Next, the Lord says that people who worship Him while yearning to experience the Self are freed from return too."

            "It is ancient and not subject to creation and destruction - it lasts forever. Even while being inside everything in space, in everything that goes into creation, in everything that\u2019s created, even when all of this is destroyed, it doesn\u2019t perish. It is called imperceptible and imperishable in several Shlokas:Chap.12#3: \u2018those who focus on the indestructible, which cannot be distinguished, which isn't evident to our senses\u2026\u2019Chap.15#16: \u2018Staying like an anvil without deforming, it is said to be imperishable\u2019.<br>Experienced people say that it is the ultimate goal, as said in Chap.8#13: \u2018\u2026the one who leaves his body attains the ultimate goal\u2019Thus, the one that's termed \u2018the ultimate destination\u2019 over here is the one that\u2019s not destroyed. Meaning, this goal is the Self that's free from the influences of nature. People who realize the Self in this state do not return. The Lord says - this is My 'ultimate abode', the ultimate seat from which the Lord rules over this universe. <br>The non-conscious material environment is one seat from which the Lord rules. The Self in a state of attachment to the environment is the second seat. <br>Beyond this, the pure and free Self is the ultimate Seat of the Lord, from where He rules the universe - that is the seat meant by the phrase 'ultimate abode' here. It is detached from the environment. This abode does not go through cycles of creation and destruction. <br>The word 'abode' also denotes a state of lustrous existence. Here, luster is knowledge. When the Self is entangled in the environment, its knowledge is confined. When the Self is freed from the confines of the environment, it is an unbroken expanse of knowledge. This is the superior state of existence.<br>In the next Shloka, the Lord says that those who know will aim to attain something that's totally distinct from what has just been described."

            "All beings exist inside the Lord. He is the ultimate being who pervades everything. <br>He can be obtained through devotion, practiced without attachment towards anything else - as said in Chap.8#14: \u2018I am easily available to a person who thinks about Me at all times, right from the time he starts his journey to achieve Me. He is My devoted follower. He doesn't let his mind wander among other subjects. He is always attached to Me.\u2019The previous Shloka described the person who yearns to know the true nature of the Self \u2013 this person realizes the true nature of the Self and the Lord presiding over it. In this Shloka, The Lord described a person who yearns for the Lord Himself. Next, the Lord describes the path taken by both of them when they depart from the body.<br>Both types of people go on the \u2018path of luster\u2019. This path doesn\u2019t put them on the inevitable cycle of return.<br>There are two possible paths when we depart from our body. One path leads to rebirth, while the other leads to freedom from birth and death. The one that leads to rebirth is called [dhUmAdi mArga], literally \u2018the path of smoke\u2019. The other one called [archirAdi mArga], literally \u2018the path of luster\u2019, is the one that leads to Moksha - freedom from this cycle.<br>The scriptures describe their path:The [panchAgni vidyA] in [ChAndOgya], 5-10-1 says: 'Those who know the true nature of the Self in this way, as well as those who worship the Lord by dedicating their thoughts to Him will take the path of luster and meet the dawn of freedom'. It describes the path that leads to the Lord Himself. <br>It also says that the path doesn\u2019t force you to return. <br>[ChAndOgya], 4-25-6 describes the end-point of this path: 'The guide leads them to the Lord. Once they proceed, they do not return to the cycles of this human world'.<br>The knowledge described above in the [panchAgni vidyA] is not about knowing the Self. Such knowledge is described elsewhere in the scriptures \u2013 that is about knowing who you are and doesn\u2019t lead to liberation. Those who know the Self as an attribute of the Lord are the ones who attain liberation.<br>Further in the [panchAgni vidyA], in [ChAndOgya], 5-9-1, it says that the Self gets associated with the elements of nature. In [ChAndOgya], 5-10-7, it says that virtue leads to a fortunate configuration of the elements, like a human body. Vice leads to unfortunate configurations such as a dog or a pig. In this way, the scriptures describe the temporary entanglement between the Self and a body and the distinction between them. <br>[ChAndOgya], 5-10-7 continues to say that those who know this will take the path of luster and will not return to the birth-and-death cycle.<br>In this way, The Lord showed the distinction between the Self and the environment. We need to rise above the environment and gain consciousness that\u2019s separate from the environment. In this way we take the path of luster and don\u2019t need to return.<br>Having realized the true nature of the Self, a person knows that it has the Lord as its Self. The Self exists only for the Lord\u2019s purpose. This is told in the [br\u2019hadArAnyaka]. With this awareness, he gains a form that is equal to attaining the Lord Himself \u2013 just like a person who intends to attain the Lord directly."

It is concealed the most, beyond everything that\u2019s concealed from us. <br>The phrase [rAjavidyA] in this Shloka could also be interpreted as 'a learning fit for kings'.

What\u2019s learnt stays with such people.<br>This awareness is supreme and pure. It takes away all faults that come in the way of attaining Me, not leaving any flaw behind. It\u2019s there for us to experience - to comprehend using our sense organs and our thoughts. Written as the Lord's words: 'When I am worshipped with service in the form of devotion, I become perceptible to the person who worships Me'.<br>It also has virtue embedded in it - 'Virtue' is practiced to achieve glory. Achieving Me is the highest glory. By its very nature, this devotion is an excess of love that's impossible to describe in words.<br>You perceive Me with devotion. Though perceiving Me is excellent by itself, it's really a means to experience Me completely. You achieve Me in My unsurpassed form.<br>You could choose to practice it very easily, because it has an un-measurable amount of love in it. <br>It never wears out - even after achieving Me, it does not get spent. Even after presenting Myself to the person who worships Me in this way, I keep feeling that there\u2019s something I still owe this person."

I pervade by being embedded in everything - in a form that's invisible and not accessible by any sense organ. I pervade this world to control and carry it forward.<br>This pervasive nature of the Lord embedded in everything is also described in:[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3: 'The one who is on the Earth... whom the Earth does not know'[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: 'The one who is inside the Self... whom the Self does not know'. Thus, the way in which all beings are pervaded has been described - conscious and non-conscious beings have the Lord embedded in them, while they don't see it. <br>Then the Lord says it the other way around- 'All beings are in Me'. <br>In other words: \u2018All beings are in Me, while I am embedded in them\u2019. <br>Further, the [br\u2019hadArAnyaka] describes the dependence of everything on the Lord. Every entity is controlled by Him, as though it were His body: 'The One whose body is the Earth, The One who controls the Earth while being inside it' and 'The One whose body is the Self, The One who controls the Self from the inside'.<br>Then the Lord says: 'I am not contained in them'. With this, He states- \u2018I am not in a state of dependence on these beings. I need no returns from them\u2019.<br>The Lord continues: \u2018I am not bound to carry all beings\u2019 - when I say that I carry all beings, it isn\u2019t similar to a pot that carries water for some purpose. Then how does all this exist? The universe exists by My will.<br>The Lord elaborates in this Shloka: \u2018Look at My status as being the owner of the universe\u2019. Look at this astonishing state of being. It is unique to Me and doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else. What is this state of being? The Lord clarifies in this Shloka \u2013 \u2018I support these beings without being bound in them. My intent causes all of them to be' - I carry them and sustain them, while having no relationship of usefulness with them. I create, control and sustain purely by My intent - My intent is Mine alone, it does not depend on anything else.<br>Next, the Lord shows an example to illustrate that everything exists by his will."

            "The will of the Lord causes all beings to \u2018be\u2019",
            "The great winds exist in space. Space doesn\u2019t need anything to exist. It blows independently everywhere. Yet, know that its existence depends on Me. <br>I am the one who carries the wind and all beings. They do not experience this. All beings are situated in Me and I carry them.<br>The Vedas describe The Lord\u2019s power: 'The formation of clouds, the way in which the sea is limited to the sea-level, the phases of the moon, the agitation of the wind, the way in which lightning strikes, the movement of the Sun - all these exist as manifestations of Vishnu's wonderful power'. This amazing power is unique to Vishnu, not present in anything else. <br>The scriptures describe it too:[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-8-9 says: 'The sun, moon and others are carried forth by the Lord, who is called indestructible. They remain under His total control'[taittariya], 2-8-1 says: 'The wind blows in submission to His will. The Sun glows in submission to His will. The atmosphere, sky, rain and fire perform their functions in submission to His will'.<br>Till now, it was stated that the state of existence of everything is brought about by the will of the Lord. The will of the Lord does not depend on anything other than the Lord Himself. Next, He says that their creation and destruction too are also brought about by His will alone."

            "The three Vedas refer to the knowledge contained in the form of the Rig, Yajur and Sama Vedas. People who are focused only on the three Vedas are different from the ones who focus on the Vedantas (also known as Upanishads), which are at the end of the Vedas. <br>Only people who focus on the Upanishads are truly great persons. They worship Me alone, in the manner described before. Ultimately, I am the one who is to be known from all the Vedas. Knowing Me in this way, they recollect me repeatedly. Such recollection is inspired by excessive devotion towards Me. They worship Me and dedicate themselves to My study. They desire to achieve Me alone.<br>On the other hand, people who focus only on the three Vedas get free from misfortunes that prevent them achieving a world of comfort. Their method is to follow the rituals prescribed in the Vedas. Those rituals concern the forces of the environment. They consume the left-overs from those rituals. <br>Actually, with these rituals, they are appeasing forces that are a manifestation of My form. However, they don\u2019t know it, so they end up craving for material comforts. They enter worlds that are auspicious - meaning they are not mingled in sorrow. They experience a vast amount of comfort. When the effect of their virtuous deeds wanes, they end up in the human world again, with all its attendant sorrows.<br>In this way, they miss the knowledge in the Vedantas - they do not know Me and end up craving for various comforts and desires. They merely follow the three Vedas and end up returning repeatedly - they only experience comforts that are small and temporary and return to the normal world again. <br>On the other hand, those who are gifted think of Me with unbounded affection. They attain Me, the supreme and ever-lasting joy. They do not return. Their specialty is described next."

            "Having been born as a certain type of being, there are certain ways to behave and certain misbehaviors to avoid. A person who doesn\u2019t comply and crosses the line is considered very offensive. <br>When such a person worships the Lord with unwavering devotion, with the worship alone being the goal, he needs to be considered virtuous. He is a topper among the followers of the Lord, equal to the kind of people described in the previous Shloka.<br>How come? In this Shloka, the statement 'he has made the appropriate resolution' says that his determination is true and proper. This person has firmly resolved- 'The Lord is the one and only origin of the entire universe. He is the ultimate creator. He is the goal of all humans. He is the master of all things moving and stationary. He is our controller, my guide, my friend and He gives ultimate joy'. Such a resolution is difficult and rare. <br>With this kind of resolution, a person is in constant worship of the Lord - with worship itself being the goal of his worship. Hence, this person must be considered virtuous indeed and be respected. Considering his resolve and consequent worship, the malicious deeds he commits are to be considered as minor imperfections. This person is not to be disrespected for those deeds. Instead, this person must be praised - this is the summary here.<br>Now, a question arises - Will the misconduct of this person not restrict the flow of devotion in future? As said in [kaThOpaniShat, 1-2-24]: 'Those who cannot keep off misconduct, those in whom desire and anger do not subside, even those whose mind does not have peace - such people cannot achieve Him through knowledge'. Will he still be capable of devotion?This question is answered next -"

I am The One who knows everything. My every intent is fulfilled. I\u2019m The Single Cause behind the entire universe, The Supreme Creator, The best among Men. <br>My eyes are wide and pure like lotus leaves. My appearance is like a flawless dark-blue cloud. I have the brightness of a thousand suns that rise simultaneously.<br>I am a great ocean of tasty nectar. I have four gentle and large arms; I wear a yellow garment of great brilliance, decorated with a flawless crown, ear-ring, a garland, with bracelets on the biceps and forearms. <br>I am an abode of enormous favorable qualities, limitless compassion, beauty, charm, generosity, grandeur and an innate nature to look at everyone equally with an ocean of affection; I am a refuge for the entire universe without exception, accepting everyone who seeks refuge without considering any of their peculiarities.<br>I am the controller of everything. <br>Again, the Lord emphasizes - 'Be My devotee, have your thoughts stationed in Me with a limitless amount of love towards Me'. Once more, the emphasis is laid with the instruction 'Worship Me alone'- Experiencing Me is unlimited and uninterrupted joy. With such an experience, return to My worship always.<br>Worship is to let-go and run with the will of The Lord. Indeed, all actions like serving someone, transacting and experiencing are all different forms of serving the Lord. In this way, you will dedicate yourself to My worship - worship that is done out of excessive and unbroken affection towards Me, arising from your experience of Me. <br>In the same way, keep your thoughts in Me.<br>Once again, the instruction is emphasized as \u2013 [mAm namaskuru]: Occupy yourself with an intense and abundant spirit of surrendering to Me. Do this without opposing or intending to terminate the surrender - This surrender comes from an excess of affection towards Me - it comes from experiencing Me with limitless and uninterrupted joy.<br>'Have Me as your ultimate goal': The person who has Me as the ultimate goal is incapable of supporting himself without Me, hence he takes My refuge.<br>With this, fasten your mind and have Me as your ultimate goal. With an unbroken, limitless affection towards me, you get a mind that's capable of experiencing Me. With it, you will attain Me. You do this by thinking and meditating upon Me with your mind, experiencing and adoring Me, surrendering to Me and having Me as the ultimate goal.<br>Do your activities that are necessary to sustain your body, perform the duties prescribed in the scriptures and your daily routine. Do them for My pleasure, as work that I've effected, with My service as the driver. Always repeat My praise, be in the effort to achieve Me and surrender to Me out of love. Resolve that the entire universe is subject to My will. Being in My service is its only desire. Think of all My qualities. They give vast amounts of joy. Be present daily in this world and worship Me in the manner described before. You will definitely achieve Me."

With this limited knowledge, they do not know My characteristics in their true sense. <br>The Lord's true characteristics cannot be recognized by thought, even by powerful gods.<br>Next, the Lord says that the awareness of His true characteristics shall free us from our misfortune \u2013 Our misfortune prevents us from starting our journey of bhakti."

            "The Lord is without birth, He was never born. In this He is distinct from all inanimate things that keep transforming. <br>He is also distinct from the Self, which is attached to the material environment. The Self gets associated with the material world in accordance with its past deeds. This association is called 'birth'.<br>The Lord has no such birth - This distinction is described here with the word [ajam]. The phrase 'without an origin' means that the Lord is not someone who has attained freedom from birth and death. Those who have attained such freedom do have an origin, in that they attained freedom after being bound in the material world. <br>This is also evident from the [shvEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-19, where it says that the Lord exists without discontinuity. <br>In this Shloka, the Lord states - A person who knows Me in this way - as the Lord of the entire universe who is untouched by any flaw - is free of misconception. <br>'Misconception' is to consider the Lord as similar to something else. Unfortunately, such misconceptions prevent the start of bhakti. The person who does not have this opinion is free from misconception. Such a person is free from all misfortune that prevents the start of bhakti. <br>Any other wealthy or powerful leader is like another human. The person has attained that wealth and power due to deeds committed in the past. Same is the case with the gods, their superiors and Brahma, the principal engineer of the universe. They are subject to the influence of the three qualities too. The Lord is described as 'The one who created brahma' in [shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-8.<br>Similarly, a wealthy person also belongs to the same category of people who are bound to the environment.<br>The Lord of the universe is distinct from all causes and effects we see in inanimate things. He is distinct from all conscious beings, whether free or bound in the environment. <br>The Lord has the distinction of having absolute control, being the terminator of all misfortune, the single supreme controller and the single abode of an infinite variety of abundant favorable qualities. The person who knows the Lord in this way doesn\u2019t think of the Lord as being similar to something else. This person is completely free of all misconceptions and misfortune.<br>In this way, the Lord described the removal of misfortune that prevents the birth of devotion. Such misfortune is removed by a study of the Lord's characteristics. He also said that the mere removal of such misfortune leads to devotion, which then springs forth by itself.<br>Next, the Lord describes the growth of devotion by studying His attributes, His wealth and the world of auspicious qualities that reside in Him."

            "In the commentary that follows, each of the aspects in this Shloka are explained as a state of our being and our experience of that state.<br>There are different emotions, experiences and states-of-being - <br>The feeling of \u2018recognition\u2019 happens when the brain notices similarity to something it knows. \u2018Cognition\u2019 is the experience of \u2018knowing\u2019 and identifying different conscious beings and non-conscious things'Freedom from misconception' is to be free of ignorance and bias, which dull our ability to make distinctions. For example, ignorance about jewelry would make us bundle gold and pearl together. Bias would prevent us from learning the distinction between them. When we are free from bias and ignorance, we are free from misconception.<br>\u2018Forgiveness\u2019 is a state where our mind isn\u2019t deformed even in the presence of agitation.<br>\u2018Truth\u2019 is to say it 'as it is', in a way that's beneficial to the listener. It is stated here as a tendency that enables us to do this.<br>\u2018Control over voluntary actions\u2019 is to desist from unfavorable subjects. Similarly, \u2018control over oneself\u2019 is the experience of controlling our thoughts and feelings- instead of being controlled by them.<br>\u2018Comfort\u2019 is the experience of things which are favorable to us, while \u2018discomfort\u2019 is the experience of something unfavorable.<br>\u2018The state of having plenty\u2019 is a state of mind that causes the feeling of comfort. \u2018The state of discontent\u2019 is fatigue in our mind, which causes an unfavorable experience.<br>\u2018Fear\u2019 is discomfort that comes from perceiving the cause of future misfortune. \u2018Fearlessness\u2019 is to be free of such fear.<br>The \u2018desire to avoid harming anyone\u2019 is the state of not being the cause of any misery.<br>The \u2018attitude of equanimity\u2019 is to view fortune and misfortune equally- whether it happens to us, to people we adore, or to those who oppose usWith the quality of \u2018contentment\u2019, we are always joyous towards everyone.<br>\u2018Focus\u2019 is to be engaged in the occupation prescribed for us, even when comfort and enjoyment are restrained.<br>\u2018Fame\u2019 is when we\u2019re known for virtuous qualities; \u2018Infamy\u2019 is to have a reputation of lacking virtue. Here, 'fame' and 'infamy' indicate the dual states of our mind associated with such reputations.<br>Similarly, the other virtues mentioned, such as 'focus' and 'charity' refer to our preferences and tendencies. <br>All of us in this world keep going through these emotions, experiences and states-of-being. The Lord says - 'These emotions arise from Me'. Meaning, they are according to the Lord's will.<br>In the next Shloka, the Lord says that the powers behind this world are also subject to His will."

            "The Lord\u2019s qualities cannot be understood. So how do we think of Him?",
            "Arjuna says to Krishna - 'The scriptures speak about the supreme might, the ultimate abode and the supreme purity. You are that'. <br>Here are the scriptures that speak about these qualities:[taittariya upanishad], 3-1-1 speaks about the Lord in the neuter gender- \u2018From which all these beings originate, by which all beings take birth and live, in which they reside at the end - know It as the Mighty One, which is to be worshipped\u2019.<br>[taittariya upanishad], 2-1-1 says what happens to the worshipper- \u2018The person who worships this Mighty One will attain that very Might\u2019[muNdOkya upanishad], 3-2-6 says it as well- \u2018The one who worships and sees the Lord will attain equality to the Lord\u2019.<br>Arjuna continues - The One who is called the 'ultimate abode' is You alone. Here, the word 'abode' indicates the state of enlightenment. The ultimate form of enlightenment is described in the following scriptures -<br>[ChAndOgya upanishat], 3-13-7 describes the state-of-being enlightened with the Lord\u2019s awareness- \u2018It is the enlightenment that shines many times brighter than this daylight\u2019.<br>[ChAndOgya upanishat], 8-12-2 describes the person who is enlightened- \u2018Having attained the ultimate enlightenment, he comes forth in his own form\u2019.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka upanishat], 4-4-16 describes how he is viewed- The powerful consider Him as the brightness in everything that's bright.<br>Likewise, the Lord is the supreme purity - One who purifies all. To a person who remembers Him, the Lord grants freedom from disgrace and related mistakes. As said in the scriptures -<br>[ChandOgya upanishat], 4-14-3 speaks about such a person\u2019s mistakes- \u2018Mistakes do not stick to a person who worships this way, just as water does not stick to a lotus leaf\u2019.<br>[ChandOgya upanishat], 5-24-3 speaks about vice in such a person- \u2018Just as cotton gets burnt into ashes when it falls into fire, all vice in this person gets burnt away\u2019.<br>[mahAnArAyaNa], 21-3 talks about the supreme nature of the Lord- \u2018Narayana is the supreme might. Narayana is the supreme element. Narayana is the supreme enlightenment. Narayana is the supreme Self\u2019.<br>Arjuna continues- Great thinkers know the true nature of everything perceptible and non-perceptible. O Lord, they say You alone are the everlasting divine person, the origin of all powers, You are without an origin. You are the One who is all-pervading. The sage Narada and the unbound pious Vedavyasa too say the same. From the scriptures -<br>[harivamsha, vishNu parva], 123-62 describe Lord Krishna- \u2018This Narayana has the sea of milk as his mansion, has Lakshmi by his side. He has left his serpent that serves as his resting place and has come down to Mathura city\u2019.<br>[bhArata.araNya.], 86-28,25 says- \u2018The city of Dwaraka is indeed fortunate, because Lord Krishna is present there. He is the Lord who can be seen, He is beginning-less, He is indeed the eternal and supreme law\u2019.<br>[bhArata.vana.], 76-24,28 describes those who know Krishna- \u2018Learned people who know the Vedas, those who are aware of the knowledge of the Self say that the great Lord Krishna is the eternal and supreme law. Govinda is the purest of the pure, the highest among all virtues and the most favorable among everything that's auspicious. The Lord is the entire universe and all the powers in it. He is ancient, older than everything else. The Lord Hari, who cannot be grasped by thought, is now present here as Krishna.<br>In [bhArata.vana.], 90-28,32, Krishna Himself tells Arjuna- \u2018Wherever the ancient and supreme being, Lord Narayana is present, that\u2019s where the entire world is. It is home, with all the wholesome rivers. Such a place is virtuous. It is a place of focused thought. That is itself the ultimate entity, which extends through-out the universe. It is a place of powerful scholars, people with great achievements and those who have focused their thoughts... Lord Krishna, present as the origin of all power and as the great performer, is the most favorable of all places. Have no doubt in this matter\u2019.<br>[bhArata.sabha.], 38-33 echoes- \u2018Lord Krishna himself is the creation and destruction of all the worlds. Along with everything with consciousness and without, this entire universe exists only for His purpose\u2019.<br>Finally, Arjuna recalls what Krishna said- \u2018You have said so Yourself, in Chap.7#4: This universe of Mine is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of individuality. Up until Chap.10#8: People with this knowledge worship Me with the conviction that I am the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me. They are filled with feelings of adoration for Me\u2019."

Knowledge, memory and the ability to reason come from Me'. <br>In Chap.18#61, He says: \u2018Arjuna, the Supreme Lord sits at the heart of every being, spinning all beings, mounting them in the mechanism of the environment\u2019.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 5-7-15 describes everything as the Lord\u2019s body: 'The One who is present in all beings, who is distinct from all of them, the One whom all beings do not know, the One who has all beings as His body, the One who controls all beings while being inside them - He is inside you too; He is the Self that doesn't perish'.<br>[shatapatha], 14-5-30 states that the Self is also the Lord\u2019s body: 'The One who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self, the One whom the Self does not know, the One who has the Self as his body, the One who controls the Self while being inside it - He is the One who is within you and regulates your feelings; He is the Self that does not experience death.<br>In this way, being present as the Self in all beings, I am their beginning, their end, as well as everything in-between. Meaning - I am the ultimate cause of their creation, sustenance and destruction.<br>In the same way, the Lord explains that every word is synonymous with the Lord, since He is present as the Self inside everything. Knowing that every word addresses the Lord is a way to establish the uniqueness of His mighty expanse. <br>Indeed, all words ultimately conclude in the Lord, since they have the Lord as their 'Self'. They have the Lord as the basis and essence of their existence. While words such as 'person', 'bird', 'tree' are used to describe the material forms of those things, they address the 'essence' that constitute their being - their Self. <br>The Lord says that all words are bound to address Him, due to the fact that the Lord is present as the Self- the essence and the basis inside everything. <br>The Lord sums up His expanse in Chap.10#39: \u2018An object in which I'm not present as its Self does not exist\u2019. This is a statement of fact- it's impossible for anything to exist without the Lord being its basis.<br>Further, He states that this existence is subject to His will in Chap.10#8: Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me.<br>From the next Shloka till the end of this chapter, the Lord illustrates several ways to relate to His greatness."

It has infinite arms, torsos, faces and eyes. It has limitless brilliance, infinite weapons that are not bound by the material world, with uncountable decorations that suit the Lord's form. It is adorned with extraordinary garlands and aromas. <br>In this limitless and astounding body of the Lord, Arjuna saw the entire variety of the universe, which is classified in many ways: Organisms that can experience things- such as powerful people, ordinary humans, animals, stationary beings and so on; Places where things can be experienced: on the earth, under the earth, in the sky, on other heavenly bodies, at bottomless depths, below and above everything. <br>Arjuna saw the variety of environments with their varieties of experiences and instruments that enable each experience.<br>Arjuna saw the Lord as He described Himself, beginning at Chap.10#8 \u2018I am the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me\u2019, continuing in Chap.10#19 \u2018I will tell you what stands out in the favorable expanse of My might and My irresistible will\u2019, Chap.10#21 \u2018In the powers of nature, I am Vishnu, the all-pervasive\u2019, Chap.10#39 \u2018It is impossible for any being, moving or stationary, to exist without Me\u2019, finishing with Chap.10#42 \u2018I support and control this entire universe, which is situated in one part of My being\u2019."

It is meant that the Lord is the abode of vast, unbroken spans of knowledge, force, power, valor, strength and brilliance. <br>The phrase 'endless arms' is used as an example to refer to the Lord's uncountable arms, torsos, feet, faces and so on. <br>'The eyes of the sun and the moon' describe the all-pervasive eyes of the Lord, which are pleasant as the moon or scorching as the sun. The Lord is pleasant to the virtuous who surrender to Him; He is scorching to others, who always look for their own benefit and don\u2019t mind hurting others. This is said in Chap.11#36: \u2018The virtuous surrender to the Lord, while people who exploit for personal gain scatter and run in fear\u2019. <br>'A mouth that resembles a blazing fire' refers to the Lord's capability to consume the entire universe during its destruction. The Lord energizes this universe by His authority - The word 'authority' refers to the Lord's ability to exercise control over anything. Having realized this, Arjuna says to the Lord - I see You energizing this universe by such authority.<br>Arjuna realizes the Lord as being ever-present - as the creator of everything, as the basis of existence, as the one who controls everything, as the one who destroys everything, as an ocean of limitless qualities such as knowledge and compassion, with a body that's not related to any material, being without a beginning, a mid-point or an end-point. Arjuna tells the Lord - I have realized You in the same way as You described Yourself before."

It is even possible to imagine the many eyes as being two eyes in each of the many heads.<br>Any form that lends itself to express the ever-present Lord with absolute control over the entire universe can be imagined. There is no limit to such imagination. Every such imagination is right.<br>Next, Arjuna tells the Lord - Looking at You in this manner, I am greatly disturbed, along with others who see You in this way."

Arjuna was frightened by the sight of an unfamiliar form, so the Lord reassured him by regaining His familiar gentle form. Having four arms is the familiar form of the Lord, the supreme person who was born as the son of Vasudeva with the intention of favoring the world. <br>At birth, Krishna was requested by His father Vasudeva, who was afraid of Kamsa, to withdraw two of His hands. The hands were withdrawn till Kamsa was killed. After that, they appeared in their natural form. <br>Vasudeva's prayer is described in [vishNu purANa], 5-7-10 / 13: 'You are born, O Lord of gods, carrying Your conch and the disc. Be pleased and withdraw this divine form of Yours. Withdraw this form of Yours having four arms, O Lord who owns the universe'. <br>Shishupala, who hated the son of Vasudeva, always had Krishna's four-armed form in his mind as the object of hatred, as said in [vishNu purANa], 4-15-13: 'The One with four long and large arms, holding the conch, disc and the mace'. <br>It is the same four-armed form that Arjuna talked about, when He wanted to see the Lord's familiar form."

I am not seen merely by following the scriptures, by instruction, by teaching, by studying, by listening, by chanting and by achievements such as ceremonies, rituals, charity and penance. <br>With single-minded devotion alone, it is possible to know Me from the scriptures as I truly Am, to see My true form and to actually enter Me. As said in the [kaTha upanishat], 2-23: 'This Self is not realized by teaching, not by intelligence, not by listening about it many times. It is realized by the one whom it chooses. This Self shall reveal itself to such a person'.<br>The 'Self' mentioned here is the Lord, who is the Ultimate Self of the universe. From this it is known that the Lord only reveals Himself to the one He chooses. Of course, this brings a question: Does this not sound arbitrary? Whom does the Lord choose? The answer is: The Lord chooses those who choose the Lord - those who are devoted to Him, as said in this Shloka itself (Chap.11#54)."

            "Knowing is about deciphering ourselves and our relationship with the Lord",
            "Here, the words \u2018perpetual\u2019 and 'unmanifest' refer to the Self, which is self-evident in each of us. <br>It is inscrutable. Since it\u2019s distinct from the body, it can\u2019t be described by words that are used to describe the body. For instance, being male, female, ordinary or powerful doesn\u2019t describe its properties in any way.  Hence, it\u2019s not perceived by sight, speech or any of our senses. <br>This Shloka states that it is present in every body and cannot be deciphered by thought. Though the Self is present in the body, it doesn\u2019t have any characteristics of the body. Hence, it cannot be deciphered in terms of those characteristics.<br>By being distinct from the body, it remains unchanged like an anvil, even though its body keeps changing. By this, the characteristics of the Self remain unaffected by all the effects of its body. By virtue of remaining constant, it is termed as being 'unmoved and steadfast' in this Shloka.<br>Our body is a community of organs. When people focus on the Self, they control the body well. They employ their organs such as sight and hearing, instead of transacting to pursue their satisfaction.<br>They have an attitude of universal equanimity. While we perceive huge variety in our bodies, they know that the Self inside all bodies is present in the form of pure knowledge - no matter how small, large or powerful the being is.<br>With this attitude, they wish everyone well. They are free from all intentions that cause harm. That's because the intention to harm is a limitation, which comes by considering inequalities. The Self in each of us is identical.<br>By focusing on the Self, they will certainly attain Me - in addition to realizing their Self. This is stated in Chap.14#2: \u2018Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics\u2019. It is also stated in the [muMDaka upanishat], 3-1-3: [niranjana: paramam sAmyam upaiti] - 'Devoid of flaws, it attains ultimate equality with the Lord'.<br>Though the Self is permanent and achieves ultimate equality with the Lord, it remains distinct. This is said in Chap.15#16: 'The Self stays without deforming and is said to be the imperishable\u2019, going on to Chap.15#17: \u2018However, the Supreme Person is another one\u2019. <br>The [mundaka upanishat], 1-1-5 narrates: A sage called Shyavanaka went to another sage called Angirasa and asked to be taught. Angirasa started his teaching with the statement: 'There are two types of learning, the material and the superior. Material science is about observations and creativity in the universe'. He goes on to say: 'Superior learning is the awareness by which the Supreme Lord can be attained'. <br>This teaching is called [akShara vidya] \u2013 \u2018The science of the perpetual\u2019. In the [akShara vidya], the word 'perpetual' has been used to denote the Supreme Lord, rather than the Self. The Supreme Lord is described to be the creator of all beings. <br>The word [akShara] - 'the perpetual' - has been used in the scriptures, to mean the Self in some places and the Lord in others. Even then, the Self and the Lord remain distinct \u2013 The Lord creates all beings and the Self does not.<br>Nevertheless, it\u2019s extra tough to focus interest on the unmanifest Self. The goal of realizing the Self is reached with great difficulty, while being associated with a body. We are predisposed to consider our body as our Self.<br>Next, the Lord clearly asserts that He is always there for His worshippers."

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re unable to cultivate unwavering love towards Me, being unable to constantly keep thinking of My qualities.<br>In case you are unable to do all of this, embrace the pursuit of the Self. This was described in the first six chapters. Such pursuit generates ultimate devotion. As described in those chapters, be without attachment to the outcome of all actions. <br>Your love towards Me gives rise to the intention of achieving Me, only when all flaws have withered away. Keep persevering, irrespective of your senses and their desires.<br>Do your activities without attachment to their outcomes. Do them solely as My worship. Such activities enable you to focus on the Self. With this focus, your ignorance and all other obstacles are removed. <br>You will realize that the Self exists for My purpose alone. With this realization of the Self in you, ultimate devotion comes forth by itself.<br>Further, this is summarized in Chap.18#46: 'A person achieves the goal by worshipping Him with his actions', going on to Chap.18#53: 'Being free of possessiveness, he gains peace and aspires to achieve equivalence to the Lord. Once he achieves this equivalence, he gains joy. He is free from desire and sorrow. Considering everyone to be equal, he gains ultimate devotion to Me\u2019."

When compared to this difficulty, the quest for the true nature of the Self, followed by its realization is more effective in uplifting the Self. <br>Realization of the Self is tough as well, since the Self isn\u2019t really evident to us. In comparison, the method of meditation - focusing thought on the Self to realize it - is special. <br>However, even this isn\u2019t easy. In comparison, working without attachment is superior in its simplicity. Such work is a means to achieve the Self and the Lord.<br>People get rid of all flaws and gain tranquility by working without attachment to outcomes. In such a tranquil mind, they gain the ability to focus thoughts on the Self. With this focused thought, they gain the realization of the Self. Ultimate devotion comes from that realization.<br>In summary: Focusing on the Self is definitely recommended for those who aren\u2019t capable of ultimate devotion. However, focus isn\u2019t possible without a tranquil mind. In that case, it\u2019s preferable to just work without attachment to outcomes - the knowledge of the Self is embedded in such work. This helps in achieving the goal. <br>The next Shloka describes the admirable qualities of a person who is dedicated to working without attachment to outcomes."

            "The following commentary illustrates the relationship of the environment, the body and the Lord. Name anything in the environment; it has a Self embedded in it. The environment needs a Self to be recognized. In that context, the body is an inseparable attribute of the Self. The Self uses the body to experience the environment. The Lord is the controller. Though the Self and the environment exist as the body of the Lord, they are distinct with their own characteristics. However, the Lord has said in this shloka: Know me to be the knower. Does it mean He is the Self within us? Or is the Self distinct from the Lord? To clarify this, many scriptures are quoted, many questions are asked and answered in the following commentary."

            "That which knows the Self is the Lord. Doesn\u2019t that make the Self redundant? Is it same as the Lord?",
            "The capability to 'know' is the single characteristic of the Self in every body. It doesn\u2019t depend on the characteristics of the body \u2013 whether it\u2019s ordinary, powerful, intelligent, ugly or beautiful.<br>The Lord is the essence of the Self. Krishna tells Arjuna to know this.<br>In this Shloka, the phrase 'as well' in the statement 'Know Me to be the knower as well' implies that the Lord must be known as the 'knower' as well as the 'field of action'. <br>A living body merely qualifies the Self and doesn\u2019t exist without it. When we point out someone\u2019s body, we address their Self. They are both referenced in the same way. Similarly, the body and the Self exist as inseparable attributes of the Lord. The Lord refers to the Self as Himself in this Shloka.<br>Our body is a combination of the five elements of the environment - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. Both our body and the Self exist as the body of the Lord. They don\u2019t have any other existence. In other words, both of them have the Lord as their essence. <br>This is stated in many scriptures, which are listed here:The [br\u2019hadArAnyaka, 3-7-3] states: 'The One who is inside all matter, while being distinct it; The One whom matter cannot encode; The One who has all matter as his body; The One who controls all matter from the inside - Such a Self is all-pervasive and ever-lasting'. <br>Starting with that statement, it finishes describing the concept in [br\u2019hadArAnyaka, 3-77-22]: 'The One who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self; The One whom the Self does not know; The One who has the Self as His body; The one who controls the body from within - that is the essence of your Self, it is ever-lasting'.<br>The Lord is all-pervasive and is present as the essence of every Self. Hence, when we point out anything, we are actually addressing the Lord. It is stated in the following Shlokas:Chap.10#20: \u2018I am situated in all beings at their core as the Self. Moreover, I am the beginning, as well as the end and everything in-between\u2019Chap.10#39: \u2018Whatever is the source of all beings, I am that. It is impossible for any being, moving or stationary, to exist without Me\u2019Chap.10#42: \u2018I support and control this entire universe, which is situated in one part of My being.\u2019In the second half of the tenth chapter, the Lord described that he is the Self, the essence of everything. In the midst of that description, the Lord described Himself as many special things by saying \u2018I am Vishnu\u2019, \u2018I am the sun\u2019 and so on. For instance, He says in Chap.10#21: \u2018In the powers of nature, I am Vishnu, the all-pervasive. In all luminous things, I am the sun that has the greatest brightness. Among the powers of war, I am the most powerful. Among the stars, I appear as the moon\u2019The difference between kshetra and kshetrajna and the fact that I am the Self to both of them \u2013 that is the awareness you must have.<br>In this Shloka, He says - 'Learn to differentiate the field of action and the one who experiences this field. I recommend you to realize that I am the essence of both'.<br>The following paragraph tries out an opposing explanation, which ends in contradiction.<br>In this Shloka, the Lord has said - 'Know Me to be the knower'. This can be interpreted as a statement of equivalence, to mean that the Lord and the Self are the same entity. The Self within us hasn\u2019t realized that it is the Lord. This leads to the conclusion that the Lord, being present as the Self, does not realize Himself to be the Lord - due to ignorance. <br>We could hypothesize that such statements of equivalence are meant to get rid of such ignorance: For example, we may mistake a rope to be a snake. When someone shows us that it\u2019s only a rope, our ignorance is gone. In the same way, what if our awareness that 'I am aware and I\u2019m distinct from the Lord' is ignorance and this Shloka aims to remove such ignorance?Now the contradiction is presented.<br>Those who argue in this manner say that the Lord and the Self are the same entity. They are to be questioned: 'The Lord, who has taught us all this - Lord Krishna - is He free from the so-called \u2018ignorance\u2019, which says that the Self and the Lord are distinct? Or not? If He is free of such \u2018ignorance\u2019, then His Self has the characteristic of pure knowledge. Being devoid of any other attribute, there is no possibility to consider Arjuna to be distinct from Himself. Hence, there\u2019s no possibility to explain anything and get rid of anyone\u2019s ignorance.<br>On the other hand, if we consider that Krishna is not free of ignorance, not having realized the Self, then the possibility to teach the subject of the Self does not arise. <br>It was said in Chap.4#34: \u2018Those who know and show the way will preach this knowledge to you\u2019 \u2013 people learn to be aware of the Self. <br>Thus, such arguments, which say that the Lord and the Self are not distinct, go against the scriptures and other Shlokas in the Gita itself. They make the great scriptures self-contradictory. They must not be accepted, since they only serve to mislead everyone. <br>What can we conclude from this reasoning?The concept to be grasped from this discussion is: There exists inanimate matter, the conscious Self and the Supreme Lord. Inanimate matter is to be experienced, the conscious Self is the one who experiences and the Lord is the controller. <br>Let\u2019s learn about the Lord, the Self and the environmentThere are many statements in the scriptures that speak about their distinguishing characteristics:[shwEtAshvatara upanishad], 4-6 illustrates that the Lord is distinct from those who are bound by their deeds: The amazing Lord creates this universe out of the subtle singularity at the time of creation. There is another, who is bound by his past deeds.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-10 illustrates that the Lord and the environment are distinct: Know this environment as an amazing creation and the Lord as the amazing creator.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-10: The environment keeps changing. The one who assumes that he is the enjoyer of environment is the unchanging Self. There is One Lord who controls both of them. The Lord removes the ignorance that the Self controls the environment.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-9: He is the cause; He is the Lord of the owner of the body; Nobody has given birth to Him; Nobody has control over Him.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-13: He is the Lord of the environment and the one who knows the field of action; He is the lord of the three qualities.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-9: He is the Lord of the universe and of the Self; He is ever-lasting, auspicious and never diminishes. He is the unborn Lord of those who know and those that don't.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-3: He is the ever-lasting consciousness among the many ever-lasting consciousness, He is the one who grants their wishes (meaning, the Lord is present inside the Self, present as the ever-lasting entity in each conscious being, the One who grants their wishes).<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-5: The one who experiences, that which is experienced and the One who inspires everything - they are respectively the Self, the environment and the Lord.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 1-6: The devotee attains immortality through the Lord by pleasing Him. The Self is distinct, having the Lord as inspiration and purpose.<br> [munDaka upanishat], 3-1-1: Two birds are friends. They exist together in a tree. One of them tastes the fruit of the tree, while the other stays without eating, shining brilliantly. The tree is like our body. The bird that tastes the fruit is the Self, which experiences the results of its actions. The one that shines forth brilliantly is the Lord, who is not under the influence of His deeds, hence does not have to eat the fruits of His actions.<br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-5: The eternal three qualities \u2013 the white sattva, red rajas and dark tamas - give rise to many bodies, which are in turn loaded with those qualities. An eternal Self lies happily in this environment. An eternal Self that practices devotion leaves this environment.<br>[chUlakOpanishat], 5: The environment, which is without a beginning and an end, gives rise to the bodies of all beings. <br>[shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-7: The Self is trapped in the body. Without control, it is saddened due to ignorance. Once it realizes the other controller inside the same body, it realizes The Lord in all His greatness. It is gladdened and is rid of all sorrow.<br>These were some of the scriptures in which the relation between the Self and the Lord is depicted, along with the fact that they are distinct from each other and distinct from the environment too.<br>Let\u2019s look at our originEven in the Gita, there are many verses that state the origin of the Self and the universe:Chap.7#4, Chap.7#5: \u2018This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, energy, gasses, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of individuality. However, this universe I just described is not the ultimate one. Know My ultimate nature, which is something distinct, in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is sustained\u2019Chap.9#7, Chap.9#8, Chap.9#10: \u2018All beings end up in a dormant state in My body at the end of a kalpa. Again, at the beginning of the next kalpa, I create them in various forms. I create this entire system of beings again and again, while keeping My material nature as the basis. Since they are under the influence of the material world, they are not free. These activities of mine don\u2019t bind Me. Being neutral, I have no attachment towards those activities. The material environment guides this world with all its stationary and mobile beings according to My will. I am the supreme controller. This world goes through its cycles for this purpose itself\u2019Chap.13#19: Know the environment and the Self to be without a beginning.<br>Chap.14#3: This huge universe is my creation. In that, I give birth. Then, the birth of all beings takes place.<br>Meaning - The huge universe arises from the subtle matter, which is an attribute of mine. In this environment, which is without consciousness, I place the womb of consciousness. This association of the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment happens by My will. Such association gives rise to all beings in the material world, from the mighty and powerful right up to the immobile.<br>In this Shloka, the environment - the huge universe - is called [brahma]. It doesn't mean that it's the same as The Lord, who is also called by the same word. The word [brahma] is used to refer to our environment in other scriptures as well. For example, [muMDaka] 1-1-9 says: 'From that, the universe called as [brahma], arises'.xIn this way, the conscious and non-conscious exist as those who experience and that which is experienced. They exist in this way in all states of being. The Lord is the inseparable essence of their existence. Several scriptures state this fact and they are quoted here once again:[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3: The One who is situated in the earth and pervades it; The One whom the earth does not know; The One whose body is the earth; The One who controls the earth from its core. <br>Let\u2019s look at our relationship with the Lord.<br>Similarly, other scriptures describe how the Lord is related to the Self:[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: The One who is situated in the Self and pervades it; The One whom the Self does not know; The One whose body is the Self; The One who controls the Self from its core.<br>Identical statements are present in [subAla upanishat], illustrating that the universe, our environment and the Self are the body of the Lord: 'The One who is active inside the earth; The One whose body is the earth; The One whom the earth does not know', 'The One who is active in the Self; The One whose body is the Self; The One whom the Self does not know' and 'The One who is active in the perishable; The One whose body it is; The one whom the perishable does not know. <br>In this way, Lord Narayana is the core Self of all beings, untainted by actions, distinct from the material world, shining forth, the one and only supreme entity. <br>This Upanishad uses the word 'perishable' to refer to everything without consciousness, which existed in subtle form before creation. It is also called [tamas]. The usage of the word [tamas] to mean the subtle environment is evident in the same Upanishad: 'The body perishes in the Self and becomes subtle, taking the state of [tamas]'.<br>These statements are reiterated in in [ya.A], 3-11-2: 'The Lord is the Self inside everyone, controlling them'.<br>In this way, everything exists as the Lord's body, be it conscious or non-conscious, in every state of being. In fact, everything is a form of the Lord Himself. The Lord Himself exists as the origin of the universe, as a subtle singularity before creation. He exists as the effect as well, which is the entire universe after creation. "
          ],
          [
            "The Lord is both the effect and the cause",
            "Here are a few scriptures that remind us of this fact. They state that both the cause and the effect are the Lord Himself:Starting with [ChAndOgya], 6-2-1: [sadEva saumyEdamagramAsIt EkamEvAdvitIyam]Prior to creation, this universe was present as [sat] - a subtle form, indistinguishable from the Lord. It alone existed, there was nothing else.<br>[ChAndOgya], 6-2-3: [tadaikShata bahusyAm prajayEyEti tattEjO_sr'jata]It willed to become many. It created energy and the material world.<br>[ChAndOgya], 6-8-6: [sanmUlA: sOmya imA: sarvAn prajA: sadAyatanA: satpratiShThA:]It is the origin of everything and everyone. It - this [sat] - is the place of residence for all beings, The One in which all beings return when the universe perishes.<br>[ChAndOgya], 6-8-7: [aitadAtmyam idam sarvam tat satyam sa AtmA tat tvam asi shvEtakEtO]This is at the core, present as the Self inside everything. This is the truth. You are such a Self.<br>The [taittarIya], 2-6 starts with 'He willed to be many beings. He gave thought to it. He created all of this by his thought', going on to state: 'The Ultimate Consciousness became the conscious and the non-conscious'.<br>This is repeated in the Chandogya Upanishad, as in [ChAndOgya], 6-3-2:I enter the core of the three powers - energy, liquids and solids - and enable them to be called by names and be recognized by form.<br>The [taittarIya], 2-6 also states: Creating this universe, It entered and pervaded that universe itself; having pervaded, It gave rise to the Self and its association with the environment, the power to discern and the lack of it too. This [sat] is The Lord. He became the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment.<br>Before the time of creation, only an undivided entity existed without the possibility to distinguish and name anything. Only after the Lord's act of creation, this entity was separated into things that could be distinguished and named.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7 also states the same:All of this existed without being distinct, before the time of creation. The Lord made them distinct, after which they could be called by names.<br>Hence the gross universe, which is the effect of creation, as well as the subtle cause that existed before creation, all conscious and non-conscious things are the Lord's body. The effect is not different from the cause. In this way, by knowing the cause, we know everything that's created out of it. It is appropriate to say that knowledge of one gives the knowledge of everything. <br>For example: A pot is made out of clay. It\u2019s possible to consider the pot as clay, while acknowledging that they have different characteristics and uses. Knowing the properties of clay enables us to know a pot and everything else that\u2019s made out of clay. <br>Quoting [ChAndOgya], 6-3-2 again:'I enter the three powers - energy, liquids and solids - by being at the core of every Self and distinguish them to be called by names' - The 'three powers' here denote the non-conscious elements in the environment. The Lord enters them as the core of the Self in each object, which enables them to be distinguished, recognized and named. <br>In this way, every sound and expression addresses the Lord, who is adorned with the Self and its inanimate matter. Thus the Lord, who is present as the ultimate cause, has equivalence with everything that's created - this is the primary meaning embedded here.<br>If the Lord has equivalence to everything, does it mean He has ignorance as well?It is already said that the Lord is the material cause of the universe with its conscious beings and non-conscious things. He is the subtle form before creation as well as the gross result of creation - the universe we are in. Being the material cause implies that the Lord Himself became the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment. <br>Though the Lord has the Self and the environment as His body, even though He is the material cause of their association, He remains distinct from them - the characteristics of the Lord are not mixed up with the characteristics of the Self or the environment. <br>How is it possible that the Self and the environment remain distinct, even though they are part of the Lord\u2019s body? Here\u2019s an analogy: Just as colorful threads that are white, black or red come together to create cloth, the thread and the cloth remain distinct with different characteristics. While threads are the only material cause of a colorful cloth, each color is localized to the thread that went into making the cloth - even in the resulting cloth, the colors don't mix. The characteristics of the cloth are distinct from those of the threads."

            "The Self and the environment are effects of the Lord\u2019s creation",
            "The Self, the environment and the Lord combine to be the material cause of this world. While they are effects of the Lord's creation, their characteristics don't get mixed up. The Self remains the one who experiences; the environment is the one that\u2019s experienced and the Lord is the One who controls.<br>Threads, which normally remain separate, are woven together at the will of a weaver at some instant. These threads are both the material cause and the effect. <br>Similarly, the Self and the environment in all states of being - either the subtle form before creation or the gross form after creation - are the body of the Lord. They exist as entities only in the form of the Lord's body. Their form is the Lord Himself, both as the cause and the observed effect. He is the One addressed by all words, all the time - This is His specialty. <br>The environment, the Self and the Lord have distinct characteristics \u2013 The environment is inanimate, without consciousness; The Self is knowledge, which is limited in its expression according to the actions committed by the Self; The Lord always has infinite knowledge. <br>As in the case of threads combining to make cloth, their characteristics remain distinct and don\u2019t get mixed up. Given this, it's easy to recognize that the Lord's characteristic remains unchanged even after He enters everything in the created universe. <br>We realize again: In addition to being the cause, The Lord is also the effect of creation with its variety of entities that have various names and classifications. The Lord is present as the Ultimate Self inside everything. The word 'effect' just means that a different state of being is attained.<br>Those who vouch for the Lord as being 'without form and without qualities' mean that the Lord is devoid of any limiting qualities.<br>[ChAndOgya, daharavidyA], 8-1-5 describes that the following qualities are present in a small space inside our hearts: First, it is stated that this space is without limitations: Without flaws, without ageing, without death, without sorrow, without hunger, without thirst. The Lord is present in this space. His auspicious qualities are described: He has everything He wished; His every will is realized.<br>The Lord is without limitations. The word \u2018qualities\u2019 often refers to our limitations. Hence the statement is made in some scriptures that 'The Lord is without qualities'.<br>Certain scriptures describe the Lord as having a form of pure knowledge. They refer to the form of the Lord, who knows everything and is all-powerful, as being represented by pure knowledge that shines forth by its own strength. The form of the Lord is knowledge; He is devoid of limitations and has all auspicious qualities.<br>As said in [muNDaka], 1-1-9:He knows the broad expanse of knowledge and has depth in each subject.<br>In [shvEtAshvatara], 6-8:The Lord's ultimate strength is heard in many different ways. This strength is natural to Him, so are his knowledge, power and activities.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 2-4-14 remarks:With what should we know the One who is the knower? This question reflects that we can know the Lord, who knows everything and is knowledge Himself, only with His grace.<br>The statement in [taittarIya], 2-1: [satyam jnAnam anantam brahma]'The Lord is the truth, knowledge and is without an end' - Refers to the Lord in the form of knowledge that shows itself. When we are rid of the influence of our deeds, this knowledge shines forth by itself and we realize the Lord.<br>Many scriptures state that the Lord became the universe with all its beings. Let's look at them next:[taittarIya], 2-6 says: 'The Lord wished to become many'. So also does the [ChAndOgya], 6-2-3: 'The Lord willed to be many' and the [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7: 'It distinguished itself into many forms and names'. All of them state that the Lord Himself is present in many forms by His own will - this constitutes all of the various states and forms in which we see things.<br>Several scriptures state that nothing exists without having the Lord at the core of its Self. The existence of many independent things is a myth:[kaThOpanishat], 2-2-10 starts with: 'The person who sees differently over here will go from one death to another' and goes on to say: [nEha nAnA_sti kinchana] - 'Many different things don't exist here'.<br>Similarly, [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 2-4-14 says: 'The person who believes that there is a second thing separate from the Lord will see various different things. The person who believes that everything has the Lord as the ultimate Self - what does he see, using what does he see?' Meaning, both the eye and the object of sight have the Lord as their Self.<br>Quoting [ChAndOgya], 6-2-3 again: 'It gave rise to many'."
          ],
          [
            "The Self and the environment have their own characteristics, while being part of the Lord\u2019s form.",
            "Scriptures like these state that the many things we experience are the Lord's form, created by the Lord's will. Of course, this does not deny the existence of the Lord in multiple forms, resulting in the experience of multiple things. <br>Statements like the one in [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 4-5-15: 'When a person sees everything as his Self' - may seem like they deny variety. Yet, their meaning is realized by keeping in mind that everything is a form of the Lord. Further reinforcing this, [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 2-4-6 says: 'All knowledge stands against a person who believes that there are things that don't have the Lord as the Self'[subAla], 2 says: All Vedas are just the breath of the great Lord.<br>In this way, the scriptures that describe the distinct forms and characteristics of the Self, the environment and the Lord do not contradict the other scriptures that hold out the singularity of cause and effect, describing everything as the Lord Himself. <br>The Self and the environment exist as the body of the Lord always. They have the Lord at the core, controlling them. This holds good in the subtle form in which they were present before creation - when they could not be distinguished by form and name. It also holds in their explicit form after creation, when they can be distinguished by names. This is known from all scriptures. <br>If we take the scriptures stating the singularity of the Lord literally, then the Self would itself be the Lord, then the Lord would have ignorance. This goes against all knowledge in the scriptures. There is no scope of maintaining this kind of singularity.<br>This was a very elaborate and sufficient discussion of the subject."

            "The Self and the environment have their own characteristics, while being part of the Lord\u2019s form.",
            "The true nature of the body and the Self has been told by Rishis such as Parashara in many ways.<br>Parashara was a great sage who described the three elements in the Vishnu Purana - the Self, the environment and the Lord. In that, he also described the achievement of Moksha.<br>There, he explains the three elements through an anecdote: There was once a king called Bahuguna. He set out on a palanquin, normally to be carried by four people. On that day, only three had turned up. Three people couldn\u2019t hold it. Hence, the king called on Jadapradha, who was standing by the side. Jadapradha was a sage with vast knowledge, but looked quite ordinary. Hence the king mistook him for a commoner. Jadapradha lifted the palanquin. However, due to lack of practice, he did not lift well. <br>The king reprimanded him and Jadapradha replied - 'When you told me to lift this, did you tell my body or my Self? What lifted it? The body or the Self? What are you and what am I? Hearing this, the king realized that the person is no commoner. He requested Jadapradha to teach him. A part of that teaching follows now:In the [vishNu purANa], 2-13-69,70,71: \u2018O King! You, I and others have been conceived with the elements. All our bodies are bogged down by the flood of three qualities. These qualities - <br>sattva, rajas and tamas - are dictated by the past deeds we committed. <br>The deeds that we commit are born out of ignorance. Ignorance is of two types - One is a belief that our body is our Self; Another is that the Self is independent of the Lord. This is true of all beings. The Self is pure, peaceful and never wears out. It is not made from the three qualities, it is superior, beyond any material\u2019.<br>This is continued in [vishNu purANa], 2-13-89,102,103: \u2018The Self is separate from the body, which is made up of the head and various other organs. Given this, what do I address, by the word 'me'? Are you this head? Or the chest? Or the stomach? Or the collection of legs and other organs? O King, you are distinct from all these parts of your body. Think about who you are. Focus your intelligence on this. These two distinct entities - the Self and the environment - both have the Lord as the Ultimate Self\u2019.<br>This is also summarized at the end of the Vishnu Sahasranama: The organs, the mind, the intellect, the elements, energy, strength, steadfastness - all of them have the Lord as their Ultimate Self - as does the body and the Self.<br>The distinction between the body and the Self has been told in the other Vedas as well. <br>The origin and nature of the body is described in [Anandavalli], 1: 'Space came into being from this Ultimate Self; Space carries fields (such as gravitational and electromagnetic fields); From these fields, energy came into being; From energy, fluids arose; Fluids became solids and planets. From the material of the planets arose organic compounds. Food in the form of vegetation is formed out of these compounds. From this food, the body of a person comes into being. Thus, a person is made from food and liquids'.<br>The Upanishad described the nature of the body as being made out of food. It goes on to state that the body has the breath of life and is pervaded by a mind. The Self resides in the body that\u2019s pervaded by the mind. Yet, it is distinct from the body and the mind. <br>Having described the nature of the Self in this way, it goes on to say: \u2018This Self has the Ultimate Self residing in it, being with infinite knowledge and filled with pure joy\u2019. <br>In this way, the Vedas clearly state the distinction between the nature of the body and the mind. They state the fact that both of them have the Lord at their core. The Lord is the Ultimate Self.<br>The verses of the Brahmasutra describe the Lord as the owner of the Self and the body. They do so with conviction and logic. They start by establishing that space itself did not exist forever, that it came into existence at the time of creation. They go on to describe the nature of the body - the field of action. Then they describe the true form of the Self - the Self always exists in the form of awareness.<br>Finally, they describe the relation between the Self and the Lord, by saying that the Self is a doer of actions. That doership is entirely under the will of the Lord. The Lord sets the Self into action \u2013 even in this way, the Self has the Lord at its core. <br>The reality of the Self and its field of action have been elaborated in various scriptures in many ways. The Lord says - 'Now listen to Me, I will describe it in a clear and brief way'. "

            "The origin of the body has been explained in this Shloka by quoting the stages in cosmic inflation: Cosmic inflation is the expansion of the subtle singularity, which existed before creation. Here, the subtle singularity is called [avyaktam]. The next states are [buddhi] (also called [mahat]), the plasma that resulted from the inflation, [ahaMkAra] the state in which subatomic particles were formed, [tanmAtra] the atoms and [mahabhUta], the five elements."

            "This Shloka begins with: 'The five elements; prior to those, the sub-atomic particles; before that, the state of expansion; before creation, the universe in subtle form'. This list described the ingredients involved in the origin of the body. The body is made from the five elements - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. These five elements originated from the particles that were formed during creation. These particles resulted from the state of expansion, also termed as cosmic inflation. <br>Before the state of expansion, all of this existed in a subtle form, incapable of being distinguished with names. That is the \u2018subtle singularity\u2019.<br>The 'ten organs with the mind and the five stimuli' are the entities that have the body as their home. Our ears, nose, eyes, tongue and skin are the five sense organs. Speech, hands, legs and the two excretory organs are the organs of action. The mind has the body as its home too, as do the five stimuli of the senses - sound, touch, form, taste and smell.<br>Feelings of desire, hatred, comfort and sorrow are associated with the body. Hence, they are considered to be variations in the state of the body.<br>To clarify: Though desire, hatred, comfort, sorrow are experienced by the Self, those experiences come out of its association with the body. Since these experiences are effects of the body, they are considered as different states of the body. This is stated later in this chapter, Chap.13#20: 'The Self experiences comfort and sorrow by virtue of being associated with the body'. <br>A combination of all these elements constitutes the body, which exists as a base on which the Self can experience feelings such as comfort and sorrow. The body is the base for worldly experience as well as the achievement of Moksha. That is why this Shloka states that 'The body supports the existence a conscious being'.<br>In this way, the field of action - our body - started with the environment in the subtle singularity and ended up in this world. It is made out of the five elements, contains the organs and undergoes change due to love, hatred, comfort or pain. It is a combination of all these entities, existing as a base for the conscious Self to have its experiences. This is our body in brief, along with its various states.<br>Next, the Lord describes the virtues that go with Self-awareness. These virtues are present in the activities of our body."

            "The Lord continues - <br>The Self is always evident to us. Its nature must be grasped by the virtues described before in Chap.13#7. <br>I will clarify the nature of the Self now. You will grasp the Self with this knowledge. <br>By nature, the Self is not subject to the laws of the material world. It is free of birth, old age and death. It has no beginning, likewise no ending either. This is said in [kaTha upanishat], 2-18: 'It is not born, does not perish, it is full of wisdom'. <br>The Self realizes My supremacy, as I said in Chap.7#5: \u2018Know My ultimate nature in the form of a conscious being, by whom this world is sustained\u2019By being the body of the Lord, It is in the very nature of the Self to enjoy being under the service of the Lord. This is said in the [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: \u2018The One who is situated in the Self and pervades it; The One whom the Self does not know; The One whose body is the Self; The One who controls the Self from its core\u2019.<br>And in [shvEtAshvatara], 6-9: He is the Controller of the one who controls the organs. He has no origin, He has no controller. In [shvEtAshvatara], 9-16: He is the owner of both the Self and the environment; The Lord of all qualities.<br>The knowledge in the Self is infinite. It is distinct from the body and not bound by it. As said in [shvEtAshvatara], 5-9: The Self is able to achieve the state of boundlessness. Being bound to a body is the outcome of the actions committed by the Self. When the Self is free from the bonds of action, it reaches infinity. <br>The word [brahma] in this chapter refers to the unbound Self. The word [brahma] is used this way in other Shlokas too - as in Chap.14#26: 'With focused devotion, a person completely overcomes the three qualities and is cut out to [brahmabhUya] \u2013 the experience the Self in its true form\u2019 and in Chap.18#54: 'Having realized the Self, with a serene mind, he doesn't get upset and doesn't yearn. Such a person realizes the equivalence among all beings. He attains ultimate devotion to Me\u2019.<br>The last part of this Shloka says - 'This state is not the one in which the Self is bound to this environment. It is also not the state when the Self is present in the subtle singularity'. <br>When liberated, the Self is not associated with being the cause, nor the effect. The words \u2018cause\u2019 and \u2018effect\u2019 don\u2019t relate to the state of the Self. While interpreting this Shloka, the word '[sat]' is mapped to the state after creation, where things can be distinguished and be named. '[asat]' is the state before creation, when this could not be done. <br>This interpretation is supported by the scriptures:[Anandavalli], 7: '[asat] was the state that existed before all this. Then [sat] was born' and [br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7: 'At that time (before creation), this world was undivided. The Lord created the classifications with names and forms'"

Hence, these terms don't describe the nature of the Self.<br>The phrase '[asat] was the state that existed before all this' says that the universe and its beings were the body of the Lord before creation, though in subtle form. <br>Before creation, the Lord had His body (the universe) in subtle form. That was a state in which nothing could be distinguished by a name. Even in this state, the Self is still bound to the material world due to its actions. That does not describe its true nature."

To the ignorant, it seems to vary based on the form of the being - some beings have a powerful form, some don't and so on. <br>Usually, the Self is equated to the body, when we say 'I am powerful', 'I am ordinary' and so on. Yet, it is distinct from the body - it is capable of awareness, while the body isn\u2019t.<br>It is possible to know the Self, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter (Chap.13#2). It is possible to know the Self as being distinct from the variety of bodies it occupies - this is expressed here by the phrase 'It wears the form of the being it owns'. <br>We must realize that the one who wears the body - the Self - is distinct from the body itself. The body is formed by bringing the elements of nature together. It is possible to know that the wearer of the body is distinct from the body which is worn. <br>This is illustrated in the Shloka with an example: Our body absorbs nature. We eat things made from the elements of nature, such as rice. It is possible to know ourselves as those who eat, distinct from the food being eaten. <br>The Self in our body causes the transformation of food. The food we eat transforms into tissues, blood and other parts of the body, producing the experience of thriving growth and sustenance. <br>The Self is distinct from that food, before and after this transformation. This is evident by the fact that a dead body does not transform food into anything. So, the combination of elements that form the body cannot be the cause of this transformation."

These activities lead to experiences that keep happening, as long as the Self is in the body. <br>The role of the Self is to preside over the body and sustain it. In support of that fact, the Brahmasutra says: [kartA shAstrArthavatvAt] - the Self initiates action.

Everything else goes according to the Lord's will. <br>In summary:The Self presides over the body and sustains it, bringing initiative - that's it. Experiences such as comfort and pain come from its association with the material world. In other words, our body is the field in which comfort and pain are experienced by the Self.<br>In this way, the division of work between the environment (the body) and the Self was described. It holds as long as the Self and the body are bound together. <br>Next, the reason for the Self to be bound in material experiences is described.

In this way, the Self is the owner of the body, its organs and the mind.

            "My universe is the origin from which everything came into being. That is My womb. In that, I infuse consciousness and give birth. The Lord described this in Chap.7#4 by explaining His material attribute: 'This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of individuality.'Before creation, the Lord\u2019s inanimate matter exists as the subtle singularity. At the time of creation, it changes into plasma, then into the state in which subatomic particles were formed, then the atoms and then the five elements of Solids, liquids, gasses, energy and space.<br>Since it expands into this huge universe, it's called as [mahat brahma], the one which becomes huge.<br>It is not common to use the word [brahma] to refer to the universe. The word [brahma] means something that's expansive. Though it is commonly used to describe the principal architect of the universe, it is also used in several places to mean the universe itself. This is illustrated next.<br>In the scriptures, the universe has been referred to by the word [brahma], as in [muMDaka, 1-1-9]: \u2018This material world gets created, becomes recognizable and gets ready to be experienced. This material world, known as 'brahma' comes from the One who is aware of everything, has full depth of understanding and whose endeavors are full of awareness\u2019. <br>The inanimate matter in the material world is one attribute of the Lord. The conscious Self is the other. <br>The Self is described to be beyond the material environment in Chap.7#5: \u2018My ultimate nature is distinct from the universe. It is in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is sustained\u2019. This supreme attribute of the Lord has been described as the set of all that\u2019s conscious. <br>The conscious Self, when infused in the environment, acts as the seed to create all beings. This is how these beings are created in the womb. <br>The Lord continues - 'In the huge universe, which is My inanimate womb, I give birth \u2013 I bring together this environment and the collection of consciousness.<br>The inanimate environment is experienced; The Self is the one who experiences \u2013 this attribute of Mine brings consciousness to the world. I bring the Self and its environment together. <br>Then, all beings, right from the principal engineer of the universe down to a germ, come into being from My two attributes - the environment and the Self. They are joined by My will'.<br>Next, the Lord says that even after creating this universe, He continues to bring together His inanimate and conscious attributes in each being that is born."

In fact, they define the nature of the material environment. <br>They are not perceived directly. They are perceived only by the effects they bring - The quality of sattva brings learning, rajas brings desire and hatred, tamas brings reluctance to act. <br>They don't exist before creation, when the environment is in its subtle state. They come into being during cosmic inflation, when the subtle singularity changes into a state of plasma, becoming sub-atomic particles that evolve into the five elements. Unique combinations of those elements produce human bodies and other forms. <br>A Self that\u2019s bound to the environment is associated with one of these bodies. It is the owner of that body. While the body changes, the Self never changes or wears out. By its nature, the Self is not associated with the three qualities. Yet it\u2019s tied down by them when it is in the body.  Its bondage is caused by being inside a body.<br>Next, the Lord describes the characteristics of sattva, rajas and tamas. He also describes the way in which these qualities bind us."

By their very nature, they bind us to the material world. <br>All these three qualities exist all the time. They generate effects that are opposite to each other - such as awareness and ignorance. How do they generate contradictory effects on the body? This question is answered next."

What follows is the \u2018happening\u2019 \u2013 the action may happen or not; the outcome may be perceived as favorable or unfavorable; he may feel elated or disappointed \u2013 all of these are a result of the qualities of nature. <br>These qualities attach to the Self as a result of actions committed in the past. Actions are \u2018committed\u2019 when we believe that what \u2018happens\u2019 is under our control and get attached to it, instead of recognizing that outcomes happen as a result of the qualities of nature."

            "A person suppresses the qualities of rajas and tamas comprehensively and cultivates sattva. He does this by consuming food and nourishing the body in-line with the quality of sattva. With work that\u2019s done without attachments, only for the Lord's worship, he cultivates sattva. It then gains predominance in him. This person has seen and uncovered the true nature of things. <br>This Shloka says - ' Other than the three qualities, an intelligent person doesn\u2019t see a cause of outcomes in anything else\u2019. When such a person doesn\u2019t see anything other than the three qualities in making things happen, he knows beyond these qualities'Meaning, such a person sees that the three qualities make outcomes happen in accordance with their respective qualities. Having seen this, he realizes that the Self does not make things happen. He realizes that the Self is distinct from the qualities that make things happen. Such a person shall attain My state of being; he becomes equivalent to Me. <br>In summary, what the Lord said is - The Self is pure and free by nature. It is limited by attachment to actions, due to various deeds committed in the past. This causes its 'doership' in various actions. By nature, the Self does not make things happen. It has the form of pure and limitless knowledge. When a person realizes this true nature of the Self, he attains equivalence to Me.<br>Having seen that the Self does not make anything happen, that it is different from the qualities, a person attains equivalence to the Lord - this has been said. What does it mean to attain equivalence to the Lord? That is explained next."

The characteristics were covered in the previous Shlokas. This Shloka is about behavior and the next two are about the method.<br>This person considers comfort and sorrow equally by standing in his Self. Being content with his Self, he considers everything else - joys and sorrows, births and deaths - with equanimity. In the same way, he has the same outlook towards a lump of clay, a stone or gold, weighing the favorable and the unfavorable equally. <br>This person knows the Self from the body, hence he weighs praise and insults equally - praise and insults relate to some advantages and shortcomings, which are limitations of the body. <br>They aren\u2019t related to the Self. If we care for them, it is due to the misconception that the human form is the Self. This misconception gives rise to fame, infamy, friendly and unfriendly perceptions. Actually, none of them relate to the Self. <br>In this way, the person relates equally to all of them, being able to leave attachment to any pursuit that comes from owning a body. This person is said to have crossed over the qualities.<br>Next, the Lord states the greatest enabler in crossing over these qualities."

The [kaThA upanishat], 6-1 says 'With its roots at the top and branches below, this pepal tree is ancient'. <br>[yajur vEda], 1-11-5 says 'The person who knows the pepal tree well - with the roots above and branches below - is the one who knows'.<br>Its roots are said to be at the top, since the universe started with Brahma at the top. Brahma is the principal architect who made the universe happen. The various beings of the universe - plants, microbes, birds, animals and so on - are of different types, classified as branches in the tree down below. We can't cut away the flow of material experiences as long as we ignore reality and remain attached. In this way, the tree, representing the material world, does not wear out. <br>The leaves of this pepal tree are said to represent the Vedas. The Vedas specify the methods to achieve material goals like wealth and family. The world grows with these activities - hence the Vedas are like the leaves of this tree. The growth of a tree is due to the nourishment supplied by the leaves. <br>The Vedas themselves specify the method to cut ourselves free from the tree that\u2019s the material world. The person who knows such a pepal tree is the one who knows the Vedas. This person knows the nature of this tree, which must be cut. He also knows the method to cut his attachment to it. Hence, he is called 'the one who knows the Vedas'."

            "The Lord says- I am present at the heart of all beings, the place where the awareness called 'consciousness' comes from. This 'consciousness' is the awareness that brings the experience of pleasantness, initiates the process of digestion and governs all activities that are performed or stopped in all beings. In this way, I am at the core of all beings, regulating everything by My will. The scriptures say the same:[ya.aa], 3-11-2 says - 'He is the core of the Self in everyone, ruling them and pervading them from the inside'.<br>[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3 says - 'He who is situated in the earth...'[br\u2019hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22 says - 'He is present in the Self while being distinct from the Self. He rules the Self from the inside'[mahA nArAyaNa] says - 'The heart is like a lotus flower facing downwards. Everything is present within, in a subtle form'.<br>[ChAndOgya], 8-1-1 says - 'In this body, which is the Lord's place of residence, there is a small lotus, with a small space. That space is the Lord in subtle form', after which it goes on to describe the qualities of that space - its intent is always fulfilled, it has infinite joy, it has no thirst and so on - these are the qualities of the Lord.<br>In the [viShNu purANa], 1-17-20 Prahlada tells his father - 'Vishnu is the ruler of everything in the world, without exception, He pervades everything'. <br>[manu smr'ti], 12-122 says - 'He controls everything, being smaller and subtle beyond anything else'.<br>[manu smr'ti], 8-92 says - 'The Lord, who is the controller and the regulator, is present at your heart'Hence, everyone's memory comes from Me. This 'memory' is the awareness that comes from merely re-living a past experience. Awareness is to infer and recognize things based on experiences from various organs. <br>Forgetfulness and the inability to reason is from Me. The power to reason comes from Me, as well as the ability to anticipate, says the Lord. This comes to us in the form of 'I have learnt this fact (a fact like gravity); I see the situation (like a stone being tossed); I can reason what's next (the stone will fall)'. The chain of events that happens after this (the stone hurting someone) adds to our learning. In this Shloka, The Lord said 'All this comes from Me'. <br>'I alone am to be known from all the Vedas' - The Vedas describe natural phenomena like fire, wind, the Sun, the Moon, acts of nature and so on. I am inside all of them, at the core of their Self. Hence, I am the One to be known from all the Vedas. The words 'human', 'god' and all others refer to the Self in them. The Vedas describe the methods of worshipping the gods, along with the results of such worship. <br>It is the Lord who is being worshipped by all methods, being at the core of every Self.<br>'I make the end of the Vedas' - the Vedas end in the fruits of the actions they prescribed. 'Making the end' here means that the Lord makes the fruits - He is the One who gives the result stated in the Vedas.<br>This was stated previously, starting with Chap.7#21 and Chap.7#22: 'Which ever devotee likes to please what ever form with dedication, I give stability to the same faith in each of them. With that dedication, the person wishes to worship accordingly. By this he attains his desires. These desires are given by Me alone' and in Chap.9#24: 'I am indeed the enjoyer and the single Master of all services rendered to anyone or anything. Those who crave for material wealth do not know Me as I am. Hence, they fall back'.<br>'I am the One who knows the Vedas': All the Vedas describe and address the Lord. The Lord says 'I know this fact'. Those who speak other meanings of the Vedas do not know the Vedas - that is the opinion expressed here.<br>'Hence, listen to the one summary of all the Vedas from Me' - continues the Lord."

            "In My Universe, the perishable and imperishable beings are well-known. The person termed 'perishable' here is what we call 'living beings', starting with Brahma, the principal engineer of the material world, right up to even single-celled organisms. It's in their nature to wither and perish, being created in combination with materials. In this Shloka, they are all bundled together as one person, since they all have a common characteristic - they are bound in the material world.<br>The one who does not change, called as the 'imperishable' is free from the attachment to the inanimate material world. He is free by nature and stays in his natural form. <br>Without attachments to anything inanimate, he does not have any characteristics to differentiate him. The rest of us are differentiated by the body we are bound to. That includes Brahma too. <br>Since the free Self does not vary, he is also called as 'invariant'. Just as an anvil stays invariant while forging, every Self remains without changing. Since all of them are common in their characteristic of being free from the material world, this Shloka groups them together as 'the imperishable'. <br>This group is not restricted to those who have been free forever - it also includes those who are free now, who were bound previously - as said in Chap.4#10: 'Many people have taken refuge in Me, discarding desire, fear and anger. They fill Me in their minds. They have been purified by pursuing My knowledge in a single-minded way and have attained My qualities' and in Chap.14#2: 'Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics. They are not born again even at the time of creation, nor do they perish when the universe perishes'"

They are: Inanimate matter, Conscious beings who are bound with it, Conscious beings who are free from it.<br>The Lord pervades all three of them as the core of their Self and supports them. In this way, He is distinct from those who are pervaded and supported by Him. This person, who has been described as being distinct, is the Lord. <br>He does not wear out. In this way, He is unlike the material world, which does wear out. Since He is not bound by matter, He is distinct from all beings that are attached to matter. By being the Lord and controller of everything, He is unlike the other beings that are free of the material world as well."

            "This commentary explains each of the above characteristics.<br>Freedom from fear. Fear is a discomfort that\u2019s experienced when we imagine the sadness of undesirable happenings- being separated from what we love and being associated with what we hate. The absence of this fear is the characteristic of being 'free from fear'.<br>'A clear mind' comes from focusing the mind inwards, losing attachment to the qualities of rajas and tamas.<br>This person 'Settles in the knowledge of the Self' by dedicating to realize the Self and distinguish it from the environment.<br>'Generosity' is to give away our earnings to those who deserve it.<br>'Control over our organs' comes from the regular practice of bringing the mind away from its pre-occupation with material subjects.<br>'Worship of the Lord' is about doing our duties without attachment to results, purely as worship to please the Lord.<br>The characteristic of 'reciting the scriptures' comes from the awareness that they describe the Lord with all His wealth and power, along with the methods to worship Him.<br>'Dedicating thought into performance' is about performing tough tasks and gaining the ability to please the Lord.<br>'Consistency in thought, speech and action' is to commit the same in thought, speech and action towards others.<br>Being 'intolerant towards violence' is to abandon hurting others.<br>'Satya' is about saying it 'as it is', in a way that's beneficial. This comes from saying what we have come to infer, saying it in a way that's beneficial to all beings.<br>'Freedom from anger' is to free the mind of the deformity that makes a goal out of hurting others.<br>Leaving things that don\u2019t benefit the Self \u2013 is the character of giving up distractions that don't benefit our Self.<br>'Being content with the Self' comes from the practice of restraining our organs from their tendency to go behind material things.<br>The virtue of 'not speaking ill of others' is about restraining statements that cause harm to others.<br>'Compassion towards all beings' comes from not tolerating sorrow in anyone.<br>We are 'without attachments in material subjects' when we don't crave for material experiences, nor do we cling on to them.<br>'Not being harsh' gives eligibility to connect with virtuous people.<br>'Prudence' is about being embarrassed to do things that are not to be done.<br>'Unwavering' is when we don't lose focus even in the presence of distracting attractions.<br>The 'the brilliance of leadership' is to be without subjugation in the face of opposition.<br>'Forgiveness' is to be free of agitation, even when we perceive others inflicting discomfort upon us - without being vindictive towards them.<br>'Resolve' is to affirm with determination \u2013 we do things that are to be done and reject those that are not, even in the face of great obstacles.<br>\u2018Cleanliness' is to tune our external and internal organs to be devoted to the Lord, as instructed by Him in the scriptures.<br>We 'do not work to put another at a disadvantage' when we don't become obstacles to others - when we don't obstruct the expression of their free will.<br>Arrogance is inappropriate pride. Freedom from arrogance is to be without pride when it's not deserved.<br>A person born with the qualities associated with a \u2018deva\u2019 would have the above properties. A \u2018deva\u2019 is one who intends to work according to the Lord's principles. Such a person\u2019s character is to follow the instructions of the Lord. A person 'born into' these characteristics is determined to dedicate his life to these principles. The purpose of such a person's life is to accomplish the above principles as the Lord's command."

The three qualities come from experiencing things around us - things like our body - which is composed out of these qualities. <br>We perceive the world by using our body, our sense organs and our mind.

            "The statement 'People torment themselves with awful struggle, going against my instructions in the scriptures' is illustrative - any struggle that goes against My instruction is awful, even when it involves impressive rituals such as charity and sacrifice. Such an activity has hypocrisy and arrogance built-in, finding strength in desire and pleasure.<br>These activities attenuate the specialty of the body - they diminish the body, not recognizing that it's a wonderful colony of the five elements - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. They also diminish the Self, a part of Me present as the core of the body. <br>Know that people who struggle this way have resolved to disregard My instructions. They are the very people who go against My instructions. By doing so, they don't get to touch even a little joy. Instead, they fall into the company of the vain and wasted, as said before in Chap.16#16: 'Indulging in their desires and experiences, they fall into foul torment'In addition to activities to achieve The Lord, the scriptures describe activities related to our environment. Next, The Lord goes on to distinguish activities that relate to our environment. These activities are characterized by the three qualities.<br>Food is the source of these activities - hence, He first describes the three types of food that nourish the three qualities. As said in [ChAMdOgya, 6-5, 4] - 'Son, the mind is defined by the food we eat' and in [ChAMdOgya, 7-26-2] - 'The quality of sattva gets pure when our food is free of impurities'. "

            "Some learned people believe that all actions are driven by desire, so they believe in leaving actions themselves - not doing them at all. This is 'renunciation'. <br>Others with experience believe in letting go of expectation in all actions. This is called 'letting go' in all scriptures that deal with Moksha. The phrase 'all actions' here includes routine actions, prescribed actions and other activities having various outcomes. <br>Here, the Lord illustrates the contention between two phrases - 'renunciation' and 'letting go', both of which have been used in the scriptures. <br>Does 'letting go' mean that we must leave expectations in our actions or leave the actions themselves? Does renunciation mean ceasing all actions? The Lord has used the phrase 'renunciation' in some places and 'letting go' in others interchangeably, affirming that they mean the same. <br>As He says in the next few Shlokas- Chap.18#4: 'Arjuna, listen to My firm conclusion about letting-go' \u2013 with this, He conveys His conclusion using the phrase 'letting go' itself. In Chap.18#7, He says - 'It is not appropriate to renounce activities that are prescribed. Getting confused and letting go of them is said to be in laziness, a quality of tamas'. <br>In Chap.18#12, He says - 'Actions have three types of results - desirable, undesirable and mixed. They follow a person who hasn't let-go, even after he departs from this world. In the next life, he is born again in one of these three situations. None of this happens to someone who has renounced'.<br>In this way, the Lord has mutually substituted the phrases 'renunciation' and 'letting go'. Hence, it is accepted that they have the same meaning."

These are activities such as eating, breathing and worshipping. <br>As said in Chap.3#8: 'Even the journey through your body wouldn't be achieved when you are inactive' - Don't give up activities in this journey through your body. This journey itself works to gain the knowledge that liberates us, by consuming the balance that remains from worship. Otherwise, as said in Chap.3#13: 'The kleptomaniacs who enjoy the results for their own sake will only experience misfortune'. <br>In this way, when the body is built from food other than the food that is derived from worship, it acts as a contaminant and forms the base of false knowledge. <br>Food nourishes the mind, as said in [chAndOgya], 6-5-4: 'Son, the mind is constituted from the food we eat\u2019. Again, as said in [chandogya], 7-26-2: 'When the food is pure, the mind is not contaminated. A clean mind is capable of strong awareness. All knowledge can be released with the strength of this awareness'. <br>Thus, it is learnt that knowledge to realize the Self rests on the sanctity of the food we consume.<br>That's why it's not appropriate to give up routine, prescribed activities in this journey through the body. Routine activities such as eating and prescribed activities such as worship are meant for knowing the Self. <br>The quality of tamas gives rise to the misconception that these actions are binding in nature - though in reality, such actions actually lead to knowledge that liberates us. When we give up these activities due to such misconceptions, we remain in the quality of tamas. Indeed, the quality of tamas is the source of ignorance. As said in Chap.14#17: 'Mistakes, misconceptions and ignorance come from the quality of tamas'.<br>Ignorance is made from misconceptions that repel knowledge. Further in this chapter, it is said in Chap.18#32: 'People are overwhelmed by the quality of tamas when they understand their duty to be contrary to prescribed actions. Their intentions are born in the quality of tamas and go against any kind of achievement'.<br>In this way, misconceptions result in giving up routine and prescribed activities."

In this manner, he has let go of all outcomes - other than the outcome of achieving the Lord. Hence, he doesn't have likes and dislikes towards his work. The misfortune of encountering an undesirable effect comes from our flaws - it's unintentional and comes from ignorance.<br>It is said in [kaThOpanishat], 1-2-23: 'This knowledge is not achieved by people who are restless, not by those who conduct misdeeds, not by those who are not at peace, who do not apply themselves, even though they may try by learning a great deal'. <br>The statement here, is that misdeeds and instability are opposed to the growth of knowledge.<br>In this way, 'letting go' is about giving up attachment to actions, their outcomes and giving up the sense of 'I made it happen'.

This is the distinction asserted over here. <br>Working to earn Moksha is illustrated in [br\u2019hadArAnyaka upanishat], 4-4-22: 'People who pursue the Lord wish to know Him through the statements in the Vedas, through worship, charity, discipline and by controlling their hunger'.<br>This practice of 'letting go' of the outcome of the actions we do, 'letting go' of possessiveness towards them and the misconception that we're the ones who make things happen - this 'letting go' is the same as the term 'renunciation' mentioned in the scriptures.<br>Next, the Lord describes the method to stay free of the misconception that we're the ones who make things happen - By placing doer-ship in the Lord, who is supreme and is present as the Self inside. In this way a person lets possessiveness go, even in actions that are associated with clear outcomes. <br>When we do something, it's the Lord Himself initiating activities with the Self that belongs to Him, with a body and organs that belong to Him, with His breath, for the purpose of His amusement. <br>For example, the experience of satisfying our hunger is an outcome of actions like earning and eating. The outcomes that are experienced by the Self, along with the actions that achieve it, belong to the Lord Himself. "

            "If we aren\u2019t the reason for outcomes, what causes things to happen?",
            "There are five causes of just or unjust actions. Actions are 'just' when they are recommended in the scriptures and 'unjust' when they are forbidden. These actions are done by the body, done in speech or in the mind. The five causes of action are:The base: The body is the base from which activities are carried out. It's a combination of the elements of nature. It is the abode of the Self.<br>The doer: The Self is the doer, whose 'knower-ship' and 'doer-ship' are mentioned in the scriptures: [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-19 says 'It is the one that knows'; [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-33 says 'It is to be considered as the doer for the scriptures to have meaning'The different organs: These are the organs of action. The organ of speech, the arms, legs, the excretory organs along the organ of thought form the five organs of action. They perform different functions whenever we do something.<br>The various activities: The word 'activity' here refers to the gases in our body and the activities that happen inside, such as respiration.<br>The Divine: In the field where things are combined into actions, the fifth one is The Divine - It is the Lord who is inside everything, the main cause in bringing actions to effect. As said in Chap.15#15: \u2018I am at the heart of everything\u2019 and in Chap.18#61: 'Arjuna, the Supreme Lord sits at the heart of every being, spinning all beings, mounting them in the mechanism of the environment\u2019. <br>The 'doer-ship' of the Self is completely dependent on the Lord, as said in [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-40: \u2018\u2026as said in the scriptures, the doer-ship is given by the Supreme Lord'.<br>Whatever the Self does is completely dependent on the Lord. Given this fact, all instructions in the scriptures and everything they forbid would be meaningless if we consider that the Self is not accountable for any action. Vyasa has resolved this dilemma as well, in [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-41: 'The Lord expects the Self to begin the attempt, so that His instructions in the scriptures retain their use'.<br>In summary: Actions are carried out with organs given by the Lord, having the Lord as the basis, with the strength that's deposited in them by the Lord. The Self has the Lord as the basis of existence as well, with its strength given by the Lord Himself. <br>The Self initiates its attempt to carry out an action according to its will, as per the configuration of its body and associated organs. After that, The Lord inside grants permission to commence the action and sets the Self in motion. In this way, the Self becomes the cause of action as well - by its intent alone.<br>This is similar to activities that require many people and equipment - for example, activities that result in moving a huge boulder or building a bridge. In such activities, many people and machines are considered to be the cause, with each of them having their do's and don'ts. In the same way, this Shloka described the activity brought about by the Self and the Lord."

'The one who recognizes' is the one who perceives.<br>In any action, these three sources come together - The performance of every action is associated with the knowledge required to do it, the perception to be gained from it and the one who perceives. <br>In this world, the activities and the resulting perceptions happen in the trio of the means, the activity and the doer: The \u2018means of an activity\u2019 are the instruments required for the activity. The activity is the sequence of what is done. The doer is the one who accomplishes the action."

This person turns out to be ordinary, being ignorant of the Self and the Lord. <br>Without the inclination to begin an activity, he is stiff and pretentious. He tends towards dubious activities, making him offensive. This person is vile, making him untrustworthy. Even in activities that he has started, he idles - he is lazy. <br>Due to excessive fatigue and apathy, he gets dejected. Such a person tends to spin a long yarn, plotting the downfall of others for an extended period of time. This type of a doer is in the quality of tamas.<br>In this way, the distinct forms of awareness, activity and its doers were described. Awareness initiates activity, in which we become the doers.

This happiness comes from the exclusive experience of the Self in all its characteristics. Such happiness is like the ultimate bliss. It is said to be in sattva."

The pinnacle of learning is to know The Lord as the supreme person, the One in whom everything resides, the One who resides in everything. <br>He is known as 'Para Brahma', devoid of any hint of defect. By nature, He is the aggregate of unbroken, unlimited amounts of knowledge, strength and an infinite number of favorable qualities. <br>He is the entity that has to be known by all knowledge. He alone is the single cause of the entire universe and the basis for its existence. <br>He is the one who makes everything happen. All forms of knowledge and activities are ways to adore and worship Him. <br>Conviction is to be certain about the truth - that the Lord, being adored by actions, gives the outcomes of righteousness, material wealth, desires and liberty. <br>It's said in the Gita itself:Chap.15#15: 'I alone am to be known from all the Vedas'Chap.10#8: 'People with this knowledge worship Me with the conviction that I am the origin of everything; Every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me'Chap.7#7: 'Just as beads are strung on a string, all of this is mounted in Me'Chap.5#29: 'A person attains peace by knowing me, the enjoyer of worship and prayer, the Lord of all the worlds, a friend and ally of all beings'Chap.7#7: 'there is absolutely nothing else that is superior to Me'Chap.18#46: The Lord, by whom all this is pervaded, from whom all beings get their ability to commence action.<br>Chap.10#3: 'the person who is free from misconceptions knows Me without birth and without an origin, the Lord of the universe.<br>\u2026This is conviction.

With this devotion, he achieves Me - that's what is meant here. <br>This Shloka re-stated that achieving the Lord comes through such devotion. This was stated in Chap.11#54: 'Only by single-minded devotion, it is possible to know Me as I am, to see Me and to be one with Me'. <br>In this way, devotion alone makes it possible to enter the Lord in His essence.<br>Up until now, the performance of routine and prescribed actions was emphasized. When we leave our attachment towards their outcomes, we leave possessiveness and the misconception that we make things happen. <br>When free of these misconceptions, our activity is a method to worship the Lord. These activities mature into devotion and we enter the Lord - that was also described.<br>Next, The Lord states that even when actions driven by desire are performed as described, they mature in the same way -"

            "This Shloka can be seen in two views. The first view is -<br>The second view is -<br>Commentary on the first view:The duties of activity, contemplation and devotion are methods to achieve the ultimate goal. Do them with affection towards Me, with My worship as the purpose. Leave the outcomes, possessiveness towards the action and the misconception that you make things happen. <br>Have Me and only Me as the Performer, as the One who is worshipped, as the Goal, and as the Method to achieve the goal. This is what's meant by the phrase 'letting go of everything that is to be achieved', as mentioned in this Shloka and as described in the scriptures.<br>It was thoroughly described in this chapter, starting with Chap.18#4: 'Listen to My clarification of 'letting go', which is done in three ways'. Then, Chap.18#9 talked about 'letting go' of attachment and outcomes. This is regarded as being in the quality of sattva. <br>It concluded in Chap.18#11: 'Indeed, it's not possible for a person having a body to give up all activity without exception. On the other hand, a person who leaves the outcome of his action is the one who has let-go'.<br>I will free you from all misfortune. Misfortunes prevent you from being with Me. They come from missed duties and misdeeds, committed since beginning-less time. In this Shloka, The Lord says- You let-go in this way, and I shall free you from all misfortune. <br>Don't worry.<br>Commentary on the second view:Devotion to The Lord happens when we adore The Lord, free of all misfortune and its regrets. <br>However, our misfortunes are unending, having collected since beginning-less time. They will come in the way of our devotion. <br>In the limited time we have, it isn't possible to do everything towards redeeming an infinite amount of misfortune. Hence, Arjuna feels sad that he isn't qualified to begin devotion. <br>To remove Arjuna's sorrow, the Lord tells him - 'Let go of every regret and reparation that stands in the way of devotion. Surrender to Me alone'.<br>We have committed all kinds of deeds since beginning-less time. We accumulate misfortune when we commit misdeeds or when we miss our duties. In this way, all of us have accumulated a great variety of unlimited misfortune. All this comes in the way of devotion. <br>We need to make a lot of amends and reparations to get rid of all our misfortune. Since we have a limited lifespan, it isn\u2019t possible to make enough reparations. <br>That's why The Lord says - Let go of all these regrets that are impossible to repair, which stand in the way of devotion. Surrender to Me alone - I am ultimately compassionate, I don't consider anyone to be peculiar, I am the refuge of everyone without exception, I am an ocean of affection to those who take refuge in Me. I shall free you from every misfortune that comes in the way of practicing devotion, as I've stated. <br>Don't worry."

            "'Delusion' is the belief that goes against reality. 'Awareness' is the knowledge of things as they are. Arjuna tells Krishna - 'By Your grace, my delusion is gone. By Your grace itself, this awareness has been grasped by me'.<br>Delusion is to believe that I am my body, without recognizing the Self. <br>Awareness is to know and recognize that everything - be it conscious or non-conscious - exists as the Lord's body - He is the Self in everything. <br>Delusion is to consider existence, without having the Lord as the Self in everything. <br>Awareness is to recognize that our routine activities and prescribed duties are the Lord's worship. We achieve the Lord by performing those activities and duties. Believing them to be binding in nature is delusion. Such delusion is gone now.<br>The Self is distinct from the environment and doesn't carry any characteristic of the environment. Its only characteristic is the ability to know. It exists for the purpose of the Lord alone. Being governed by the Lord is its natural state of being.<br>The Lord has the creation, sustenance and the destruction of the entire universe as His sport. <br>He repels all flaws without exception. His form is purely gratifying. <br>By His very nature, He is a great ocean of unbroken, unlimited knowledge, strength, wealth, valor, power, luster and other such favorable characteristics. <br>He is known as [parabrahma] - the supreme expanse. 'Awareness' is such knowledge of The Lord in His true form. <br>Arjuna says - 'I have attained knowledge in this form - I now know the true characteristics of the Supreme Being. I know the distinction between this Supreme Being and the rest. <br>I will end up adoring the Lord by practicing my routine and prescribed activities, having Him as my only purpose - even in the resolution of guilt. Then, with equanimity and self-control, I experience bliss in the characteristics of the Self. This gains the form of devotion. <br>The Supreme Lord, who is the subject of all the Vedanta, can only be attained by the worship of the Supreme Lord.<br>I know that You, the son of Vasudeva, are the Supreme Lord.<br>Moreover, I'm free of the exhaustion, which was caused by delusion. That delusion was fueled by feelings of pity and affection towards relatives. I now stand fit. I will do as you say right now, in war and in all other ways. I shall fight'.<br>Next, Sanjaya answers Dhrtarashtra, who had asked what his sons and the Pandava were doing in battle."
